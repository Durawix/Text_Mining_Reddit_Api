"30F, bf 29M reached out to his ex","I (30 F) and boyfriend (29 M) of four years have one child together. Recently, we got into foreplay fantasies of sleeping with other people. We both definitely played into it during intimacy. We had some issues growing between us, and were looking to rekindle or spark things between us. Well, I’m admitting and owning up to my part in this, I wanted to know what his ex of a year looked like before me. It was his only other serious relationship. He tells me and of course I did Facebook investigating. Turns out she had requested me on FB from several months ago. I never added her because I wasn’t sure who she was and the only mutual friend was my boyfriend. Well, to add onto that he had told me in the past that he didn’t follow any of his exes on social media, so that kinda made me feel bad about myself seeing that that was a lie, but also it was just an overall creeped out feeling I got when I saw she had tried to add me as a friend . He had mentioned that they didn’t end on bad terms at all, and that the last time they spoke was right after we had our baby, who is 2 and a half. He said that he told her that we were doing well, he’s in a relationship and just had a child and that she was genuinely happy for him. And per him, she was in a relationship but was about to break up with that person. Again, makes sense to me, not all relationships end poorly, and I do believe that you can care about someone without being in love with them anymore. That’s not the part that bothered me. Fast forward, he had admitted to fantasizing about her during our recent exploration into that realm, and when I mentioned that that did bother me, he said it was, “kinda my fault, since I’m the one that brought it up/her back into the picture,” with those fantasies. Okayyyyy. Well, here comes my insecurity full force, which I’m not proud of. I mentioned how I thought she looked like she been divorced 3 times and had really bad credit and did meth on her spare time. Not a nice comment at all for a person I don’t know, and I was definitely looking for validation in that moment which I told him, but his response was, “photos don’t do her justice.” And that just really stung. I know I’m the one that kinda brought it on myself, but I did wish he said something along the lines that I was prettier. Eventually I did ask him to unfollow her at that point, to which he blocked her on everything. He said he felt disappointed in me because I was acting like he was cheating, when he never did no such thing. I can understand that completely, but we’ll come back to that part as to why now I have a dinging in my head going off. So fast forward several months and we supposedly resolved this obstacle we were having; he asked me to stop bringing up his past because it was just that, his past and he told me he had zero feelings for this woman, he’s with me, not her. Okay. Now, in front of our mutual friend, somehow the joke came up about that incident to which I admitted how I was acting at that time and how I made the comment about his ex. The friend chuckled, but my bf was upset even though he had made the joke and was almost particularly defensive when I made the comment again about his ex. Now, the next morning, (ever since I had deleted her as a friend request, she would pop up number one on my people you may know list), probably cause I was surfing her profile just as much as her to mine, but she was no longer on that list. I kid you not, anytime I opened up fb her face was there! I could have blocked her I know, but I didn’t. So again, the next morning after we had that argument about her again, all of her social media was completely deleted. I wasn’t blocked, just completely deleted. How big is that of a coincidence that that would happen, only 8 hours after we had that argument? So I asked him straight out if he had contacted her when it was weighing on me. He got really upset and told me no he didn’t, not since we had the baby, and how would he know why she deleted everything cause I, quote, “MADE him delete her on everything.” I just couldn’t explain it, but something still didn’t feel right at all. I am not saying once that I believe he did anything bad or cheated, but it was the principle of lying and hiding something from me. The next day I did ask him again and expressed that I couldn’t shake something off, and he admitted that he did contact her, but per him, it was when our fantasies were first kicking off. He told me he had asked her why she tried following me, and that she said she didn’t to him. I asked for more details, and he said she said it must have been her nephew, but quickly changed it to her story not matching up. (Because of my social media surfing, this woman doesn’t have a nephew). He showed me his IG dm’s so I could see the convo, but said cause she deleted her social media, it was no longer there. That’s not true. IG doesn’t erase messages at all, their profile just won’t be there in the dm’s anymore. Even if you block someone, it doesn’t erase them. So that means that he manually deleted the conversation at some point. He didn’t want to ever tell me that he did contact her about the Facebook request because he knew how I would react. Again, never did I get the feeling he did something inappropriate it was just the lying and hiding that made me feel so sick. This turned into a big argument, but we eventually resolved it under the circumstances that I stop bringing up the past, and that he would do better at showing his affection to me so I stop doubting he loves me. I really believe he reached out to her again the night of our argument, about what I don’t know, but with that one bit of truth he admitted too, it made the coincidence even way bigger. I’m totally accepting my responsibility in all of this and acknowledging on my insecurity, but should I bring it up again? If I do, how do I bring it up in way that doesn’t sound accusatory?

TL;DR: I’m suspicious my boyfriend isn’t telling me the whole truth about messaging his ex, and it’s bothering me. How do I bring this up again without it starting another argument?",1,1l7dnpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l7dnpp/30f_bf_29m_reached_out_to_his_ex/
I (18M) am debating whether my father (48M) is a chronic liar,"I (18M) have a father (48M, a businessman) who often bluffed with various matters throughout my upbringing. For example, one time in high school, he brought me a university hoodie claiming he got it through connections with some of the professors, but in reality he just bought it online; or that him claiming Einstein went to my university to make me feel more confident about my college that I plan on matriculating. He would usually lie about things to make me feel impressed or sway my opinion or decisions. Sometimes his goals don't even make sense, like saying EVs give you cancer through radiation and that I shouldn't drive one in the future. 

Fast forward to his latest bluff. I am planning on going on a trip to Osaka this summer for 20 days with my girlfriend. He paid and booked my plane tickets. But a few days later, he showed me his chat history with a supposed seismologist claiming that an earthquake will happen in Japan during my stay, and he insisted that I leave 10 days early. However, It didn't take me long to figure out that it was a fabricated chat of his alt-account messaging his main.   

It made me sick. I had enough of it and sat down and had a serious conversation with him. He was initially being defensive and trying to keep up his bluff, saying that it was an error or that I shouldn't even be stalking other people's accounts, but eventually he admits it. 

In his defense, he said that he ""had a dream about an earthquake happening in Japan soon"" (we're Asian so I guess superstitions are normal, even though I don't buy it), and as for the chronic lying, he says that it was how he did things professionally at work and at his business, with the ends justifying the means basically. He has to manage a lot of people at work, and that bluffing is simply a more effective means of attaining your goal or to get people to do what you want. 

He did have a point by mentioning that there were a lot less arguments in our family as he adopted the strategy of bluffing about what he was doing at work to my mother, who would always complain about his absence at home and prioritizing less important errands at work over family, or maybe even cheating on her (which sounds rather dysfunctional). He grew tired of explaining himself to her and eventually he just gives up and stops telling the truth. 

He also said that he only did it for my well-being, and that he could theoretically just tell me his goals outright, but my young and immature mindset would not accept it and would waste time trying to debate with him. Despite that, I told him I didn't like it and that he shouldn't bring business practices into family matters. He eventually agreed to stop his bluffs from now on (he did seem genuine to some degree), but I cannot bring myself to trust him at this moment. My trip being cut short was not the issue. What really bugs me is whether he's justified and really meant it when he said he would change or just a chronic liar. What do you guys think? 

TL;DR: my businessman father always lies to me as a form of parenting and I do not trust him. Is he a chronic liar or justified in his means? ",1,1l7dn9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l7dn9v/i_18m_am_debating_whether_my_father_48m_is_a/
How do I get my boyfriend to both value my contributions and do more in the house?,"My boyfriend (28M) moved into my (26F) house about 4 months ago. Our relationship was near perfect before this. He is sweet, he buys me flowers, our sex life is great, basically did all the things my exes wouldn't do. He talked about ""giving me the life I deserve"" and all this stuff bc he made slightly more money than me, even though I told him I don't want that. I've always been self sufficient and want to be partners, and I think promising grand gestures is just a performative cop out compared to showing up daily. 

He lost his business 4 months ago and I told him to come move in with me and he did. He just found a job this month, but has a lot of debt so I pay 100% of the household bills. I know he's down on his luck, but the biggest issue here is I work more (overtime), I study more (he's not in school, I do certifications and am pursuing a PhD soon) yet I do most of the cooking, cleaning, and the mental load at home. I'm exhausted, mostly wondering why I don't deserve at LEAST equity. I want to be empathetic and blame it on him being depressed and adjusting, but it's been months of me doing 80% of the housework and emotional labor but he uses his free time to play video games. I can't marry him if he stays like this. I started making a list of what I do every day. I'm not asking for ""help"" I'm asking for him to do his part in a space we share. His response is ""I'll do better"" with no practical action plan. I don't think he even realizes how much more of a load I'm taking on. It's building a lot of resentment. I know this isn't that uncommon. 

Other than being passive agressive or leaving, what's the best way to deal with this inequity?

My girlfriend strangled me after a night out.,"I, female (20) and my girlfriend (24) went out to a bar with my (ex) coworkers and her coworkers to say bye to a coworker that is leaving.

Everything went well and the whole night was fun until her sister came and started talking to said coworker, we brought him to his hotel at around 5 and she wanted to stay with him. There was a discussion because we wanted her to leave with us because of her mother. And my girlfriend didn't think the idea of her hooking up with our coworker is great. Not to mention we were all off our faces so consent would noy truly be there.

My girlfriend got understandably mad at her, we left, her sister ended up following behind us but all was good. She was venting to me about the situation.

At that point of the night we were all absolutely WASTED, to the point that a 20 minute walk ended up a 2 hour walk to his hotel because we kept falling over and whatever drunk people do. I could barely walk and so did the others.

As she was venting I apparently didn't answer her on a question about her coworker, and she apparently took it as if I am defending him. I don't remember all that happened or what was said but I remember being confused on what she's even mad about and why she's going on about him to me in a mad tone, I was too drunk to understand the situation

When we got home it escalated, her mom came into the room a few times, I tried to leave, she ended up hitting me and strangling me on top of me in the bed, I must admit that I swung at her too a few times, at some point it calmed down and I ended up in bed asleep.

Next day she woke up, tears in her eyes and asked me ""Did I hit you?"", she apologized profusely and cried and said that goes all against her morals and she lost her face and that she's so sorry and that never should have happened.

I must add when we fought it never escalated to this extreme, but my thoughts are all over the place. In my head though, I think this is a one-off situation and I can trust her not to happen again because it never did until that day. She's still very remorseful and even told a friend about the situation truthfully because we ended up cancelling plans next day because we both were shook up.

I'm not sure what to think of this, I just love her, I was so scared but I still love her. What should be my next move? Should I tell someone? Should I keep it lowkey?

TLDR: Me f(20) and my girlfriend f(24) went out to a bar with coworkers. Girlfriends sister (21) wanted to leave with a coworker. Girlfriend thought I was defending him at one point, hit and strangled me. What should I do?

"I [20 F] fell in love with my neighbor [43 M], he's 23 years older than me and he has a terrible temper.","I’m 20 and he’s 43, so there’s a 23-year age difference between us. He’s my neighbor, and I really like him—I fell in love with him at first sight. He often comes over to my parents’ house (I live with my parents), and we all play board games and drink wine together. I occasionally talk to him when we’re walking our dogs near the house. Our conversations are usually neutral—about my studies, hobbies, travel, or things like that.

He’s divorced, but he has a girlfriend who lives in another city about three hours away, so they don’t see each other that often. He also has a child from his first marriage—a 13-year-old son who gets along really well with my younger brother and sister.

He has a difficult personality—he likes to boss people around, he’s attractive, and people often describe him as arrogant (although I haven’t noticed that myself).

I understand that if I were to marry someone like him, I’d probably ruin my life. I’d spend my life serving him, and because of the age gap, he’s smarter and could easily manipulate me. But I still really like him. Maybe I’m carrying psychological trauma from my first relationship and first love—he really reminds me of that first guy I was with and things didn’t work out.

It’s possible I’m just subconsciously trying to relive or resolve that old wound through him. I need advice—what would you suggest I do in this situation?

(P.S. “Just forget about him” is not advice I can take—I’ve already tried that.)

How can I get him to like me? How can I get him to see me not as a child, but as an adult? At the same time, I know that if I make the first move, he might twist the situation and act like I was the one chasing him and he’s not at fault. 

TL;DR: I’m 20, he’s 43. He’s my neighbor — we talk often, and I really like him, but he has a girlfriend and a complicated personality. I know a relationship with him could ruin my life, but I can’t forget him. I want him to see me as a grown woman, not a child, but I’m afraid of being rejected or made to look like I was the one chasing him.

17M never had any romantic interaction,"I (17M) have never had a relationship, been on a date, or had any romantic interaction.

I'm not looking to do any of that soon, as I'm more focused on hobbies and other stuff at the moment but I'm worried that when I'm in my 20s and wish to start being romantically active I'll be to behind and not be able to meet any partners.

 I understand that is pretty far away and might honestly be a silly thing to worry about, Ive researched it and a lot of people don't begin dating until they're in their mid to late 20s. 

I might be a little paranoid but I just wanted to know if anyone else on here had similar worries at my age and only started dating after turning 20?

Confused by his disinterest in intimacy when I initiate.,"My partner of 11 years and I briefly broke up a few months ago mainly due to lack of intimacy on my end.  We have since gotten back together and things were great at first.  I dealt with some sexual hangups that I had prior to our breakup and went into therapy both for myself and couples therapy.  I started exploring things to spice up our sex life and started taking an active interest in some of his kinks that he opened up about-buying books, toys, lingerie, etc…

But after awhile, I noticed that he stopped responding to my sexual advances either saying he was too tired or not in the mood.  This is perplexing since I am actively trying to make our sex life a priority.  It’s not an every time occurence but lately it seems more often than not.

What are some things I can do to fix this problem?  Why is his behavior so contrary?  Do you think he is projecting insecurities about himself on to me?

I feel heartbroken and confused about a close friend from my batch. I don’t know how to move forward.,"I've been close friends with a female colleague from my residency batch for the past 5 months. We spend a lot of time together—grabbing food, going on rides, watching movies—and we’ve grown quite close. Early on, she told me she only wanted to be friends, and I accepted that.

Still, she’s been physically affectionate in ways that leave me confused—holding my waist while on the bike, rubbing her cheek against mine, smelling me, holding hands during movies. We’ve even kissed once.

I usually cover the costs when we go out, which I’m fine with, and I’ve helped her out a lot—bringing food when she’s on call, helping with her paperwork, just trying to be there for her when she needed support.

Lately, though, I’ve been feeling emotionally drained. She spends a lot of one-on-one time with other male residents, and when I brought it up, she told me to deal with it and that she's here to make 'good friends'
Meanwhile, she gets suspicious when I hang out with my own friends and asks if there are any girls with me.

A few nights ago, she cut our plans short after getting a call from another resident. That really stung. I told her how I felt, and we had a fight. Then just yesterday, I saw her heading out again with a 3rd different resident.

I feel sad, heartbroken, and honestly unsure of where I stand in all of this. Some of my peers have shared their thoughts, but at the end of the day, I’m just really confused and hurt. I’m not sure what to do anymore.

TL;DR: Been close with a female co-resident for 5 months. She says we’re just friends, but her actions often feel more intimate—like holding hands and kissing. I’ve supported her a lot, emotionally and otherwise. She spends a lot of time with other residents, cut short our plans for someone else, and gets suspicious when I hang out with female friends. I feel used and heartbroken, and I don’t know how to move forward.

How can I 22F ask my boyfriend 25M why he has changed his phone password?,"A while back, I noticed my boyfriend had a 4-digit phone passcode, and I guessed it correctly (it was his birthday). I looked through some messages out of curiosity, didn’t find anything alarming, and never went back into his phone again.

Recently, I saw him entering a new 6-digit passcode, so it seems he changed it. I don’t want to jump to conclusions, but it did catch my attention. I’ve realized that feeling like we can be open about things like passcodes helps me feel secure in a relationship—not to snoop, but just to know that there aren’t weird walls up. That’s something I’ve communicated in past relationships.

I’m wondering how to bring this up casually and respectfully. Would it be too odd to just ask, “Hey, when did you change your passcode?” Or “Why the longer code now?” I’m just looking for a way to open the conversation in a non-accusatory way, other than this I did not have 
any suspicions of him doing anything bad.

TLDR : I noticed my boyfriend changed his phone passcode from a 4-digit (which I once guessed) to a 6-digit one. While I’m not suspicious of him, it made me realize I value openness about things like passcodes for relationship security.

"Gf(23f) lied to me (27m) about somewhat little things. I'm unsure how much I should trust her. Better to work on it, or break it off?","Hey all. So to start, my girlfriend and i have been dating for just a few months, but im starting to have some doubts already. A few months ago, she accidentally knocked one of my art pieces over, and when she looked at it, she said it was fine, but after I made a joking comment about how it wasn't, she confessed she didn't really look and she basically lied.

Another example, a few weeks ago, she was planning a bday party. I told her i dont want to go due to a lot of people going and people i necessarily dont want to see. We both agreed me taking her out to dinner would work. Yesterday, she tells me that because a friend told her I'd be a red flag if I didnt show up for the party, she now thinks the same way. I asked her why she changed her mind, and she just said she's wishy washy. so in the end , it seems like she was never fine with it to begin with.

She also has told me before she likes lying for no reason, which should've already sounded off alarm bells, but I thought I would give it a chance since I already liked her

I plan to confront her about it and explain my concerns. But how would I ever know about if she'll stay truthful? She could just say she will be honest, but be lying about that. I already told her im an overly paranoid person about relationships, and then she also gets irritated at my overthinking too she said. I really dont know how to feel about it all.

In these types of situations, is it better to converse over it so feelings are shared, or better to just break it off?

Trying to be a supportive spouse,"

I (56F) and my husband (57M) have been married going on 23 years.  We are very happy.  It is a second marriage for both of us, and we have truly learned from our first marriage mistakes.  (We were each previously married for 10 years each.)

We are there to support each other, both within our relationship and as individuals.  He has supported me emotionally when I decided to go back to school and get my master’s degree, when I made my career choices, and when I needed to lose 60 lbs (and succeeded).

I have been the breadwinner for our entire our marriage.  I also inherited a substantial amount of money from my aunt who passed away.  In 2020, he and I decided to buy a future retirement home on a lake in a rural part of the country.  (Let’s call it the Northwoods.)  We used my inheritance to make this purchase, and we took out a mortgage for the remaining balance.  (We still have our primary home, which also has a mortgage.  The two homes are about 5.5 hours away from each other.

We have spent much time up there and developed some very close friendships.  In 2023, my husband decided he wanted to retire at the age of 55.  He was a garbage man for 33 years.  It was taking a toll on his body.  I supported this decision.  He was offered a seasonal position working at a bait shop from May 1 – October 31^(st) in the Northwoods.  This is perfect for him, as he works 3 days a week (Sunday, Tuesday, Thursday) and he can spend the other 4 days a week doing his favorite thing – fishing.  He was able to collect his union pension without penalty.

We both made a conscious decision to make this work.  He would live up North from May – October, and I would stay at our primary home, as I am still working full time (limited remote availability).  We facetime each other twice a day. We eat dinner together, electronically. We also text/call several other times a day.  I drive up the 5.5 hours every 2 – 3 weeks.  He comes back home twice during the season.  In the winter, he is home.

Winters are hard, as my husband does not do anything with his time.  He sits on the couch and watches TV all day, every day.  He does not have a part time job while he is at home. 

Here is the problem… (yes, I know this is a long backstory) …

We received an unsolicited offer to buy our lake house in the Northwoods (the house was never listed for sale).  We will make about $200K (US) on the sale, after paying taxes.  We will be able to pay off every debt we have. This will be great to set me up for retirement in 2029.  We can just pack away money for 4 years and save for the healthcare expenses that will be needed to cover us from age 60 to Medicare age of 65.

We accepted this offer and will close in the next two weeks.

Now my husband wants to continue working up at the bait shop every year until I retire in 2029.  He said he is going to stay at a friends home during that time. He loves the work and the people and doesn’t want to give it up.

I am completely torn.  I 100% want to support him.  This is what he enjoys and makes him happy.

However, I am also a little bit hurt that he doesn’t want to come back home in the summer months.  I mean, we won’t have a home up there anymore.  Mind you, the friends home at which he will be staying, is not necessarily dog friendly, and we have 2 dogs.

So I will be working, taking care of the house at home, taking care of 2 dogs… all of that while my husband is enjoying his care-free summer up North.

I also know he won’t want to find a job here at home either, and I will be frustrated with the couch-sitting, TV watching man at home.

What is wrong with me?  Does anyone out there have a solution to our situation?

I want to be supportive of his happiness, without the feeling of abandonment.

\*\*TL;DR;\*\*:  Overall supportive relationship.  Husband retired after purchasing Northwoods home.  He took a part time job, which keeps him up at the summer home all season.  Five years later, the house is selling and he wants to keep his part time job.  I am torn between being very hurt and being supportive.",1,1l7coiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l7coiz/trying_to_be_a_supportive_spouse/
8 years with a passive partner - Should I stay or go?,"Help needed please❤️Feeling lost on the edge of a big decision…

I (28F) have been with my partner (28M) for 8 years, living together for 4. Over time, our relationship has become increasingly disconnected: emotionally, romantically, intellectually and sexually. I’m now at a point where I’m genuinely unsure whether to stay or go.

He’s a kind, loyal, loving person but the core issue is his passivity - he is rarely proactive in showing up for me in terms of affection, care, emotional communication and sexual intimacy. This has become harder for me to accept as I’ve grown into myself. I’ve always been the independent, high-achieving eldest daughter, the one who just got on with things and prioritised others’ needs. Now I realise I want someone who actively sees me, supports me, and shows up emotionally — not just someone who’s present, but someone who nurtures the relationship and makes me feel chosen.

Early on, our intimacy was a bit awkward but improved for a while then plateaued, and eventually faded. Over the past few years, physical intimacy has been rare - Our longest dry spell was nearly 2 years, then we had sex once in January and nothing since. I have a higher libido and am more experienced and adventurous, and I’ve tried to take the lead in making him feel comfortable (sensual gifts, compliments, open conversations, etc.) but he has tended to respond with discomfort or avoidance, which has left me putting my needs aside and feeling undesired.

Recently, we had couples therapy and he acknowledged things more openly, saying he wants to work on the relationship and rebuild intimacy. He shared his anxieties about saying the wrong thing and his struggles with sexual confidence, saying he wants to to work on things and aim for sex once a week (which still feels like a big compromise for me). But after all this time, I don’t know if I still feel that way about him - sometimes I feel uncomfortable being around him in a sexual context, other times I react positively and wonder if there’s still hope.

I’ve also felt emotionally neglected - I don’t feel romantically pursued, emotionally attuned to, or even seen at times. He’s turns up practically (does most domestic tasks, runs errands for me, plans activities) and I know he really loves me but rarely takes initiative to make me feel seen, loved, cared for or desired.

We’ve built a beautiful life together, shared values, have fun and a big friendship group that feels like family - the thought of losing all this is heartbreaking. We don’t want kids but I do want marriage one day and I’m unsure if he really sees that as a priority.

We had a 2 month break while I was on a solo trip - it added to the disconnect but made him realise the gravity of where we we’re headed. He says he wants to try but now I’m the one who isn’t sure. I’m unemployed right now and have way too much thinking time to ruminate - This whole situation is stuck on repeat in my mind. I worry that I’m being too negative or critical, and that keeping a foot out the door isn’t helping either of us try. I feel guilty and don’t want to regret how I handle this.

I want to give it one last genuine shot but I don’t know how. How do you restart intimacy (emotional and sexual) when the disconnect has gone on this long? How do you even know if the love is still there or if you’re just afraid to lose the life you’ve built?

Any advice from people who’ve been through something similar would be deeply appreciated.

TL;DR: 8-year relationship with increasing emotional, romantic and sexual disconnect over the past couple years. He is now willing to try but I feel unsure and he doesn’t push it.

How do I clarify my intentions without freaking her out?,"Hi all. I (30 M) started seeing this girl (32 F) about 3 months ago. Things have been going pretty well, and I really quite like her. We've talked about kids and future plans and she seems very interested in having kids relatively soon and settling down.... so much so that she broke up with her last bf (whom she was house hunting with) because he ultimately realized that he didn't want kids. She's really my cup of tea, and I enjoy spending time with her... she feels like 'home' a bit.

Anyways, the problem is that, the last time she asked me about my future plans I responded in a somewhat immature and poorly thought out way. I'm just finishing up my PhD , and traditionally this would mean moving away again and living a very unsettled life for the next 2-4 years as I bounce between post-doctoral positions (which could literally be anywhere in the world). I conveyed this to her, and she seemed to understand and respect my situation. At the time I thought this was fine, but I've reflected on the message I likely conveyed by what I said (and also what I did not say), and I'm not okay with that. In other words, I fear that she sees me as not taking the relationship seriously and not a long-term kind of thing. I've been pondering about if and/or how I could try to clarify what my intentions are? I would like to say that, despite my prospects, I am also equally as interested in settling down. If things really do continue as good as they currently are between us, I can see myself finding some local research position in industry, rather than chasing the academic dream abroad. However, I also don't want to come across as clingy, over-zealous, or creepy... as I know we really haven't been dating all that long. On the other hand, I know how important it is to her for someone to want to have kids and settle down with eventually.

What would you do? Should I gently try to say something like ""hey, remember when you asked about my future? I've been worried that I played it off too casually and want to clarify what my interests are. I'm not 100% committed to an academic career, and if things work out, I would be equally as happy rerouting to industry and settling down with you""? Or is this too much? Should I let it go and simply let my actions prove how interested I am instead?

  
I'd love to hear what you think about how appropriate this would be to bring up. One side of me fears that I'll come across as being too ahead of our relationship, but the other side of me thinks she wouldn't have asked about my future plans if she wasn't interested in knowing where I'm at.

TL;DR: I think I conveyed that my interest in my gf was too casual, how do I fix that? I want her to know I'm willing to settle down, and change careers, if things continue as well as they have.",15,1l7adad,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l7adad/how_do_i_clarify_my_intentions_without_freaking/
"I live (35M) with my younger sister (30M) and she is ""greyrocking"" me, snapping at me if I even interact with her and avoiding me. I have brought up in the past how it makes me feel like shit when she does this and it is deeply affecting me. How can i address this without being confrontational?","To give some idea of the general dynamic in our interaction, my younger sister is very argumentative and likes to debate me on literally *anything* and play devil's advocate on anything. It is quite impossible to ever have a neutral conversation with her, because she's always shift it into an argument somehow.

**I'm fine with this, but if I ever counterpoint, she gets angry**.

 For example, an interaction we recently had:

* Me : ""I'm really happy got this item from amazon :) . It was expensive and heavily discounted.""

* Her : ""you know sometimes amazon just ups the price and then heavily discounts it to make it appear cheaper?""

* Me : ""I know they do that - but I also did my research/looked at price history on camelcamelcamel, looked around other stores and it's pretty cheap. Also, amazon's in app scanner allows it to scan local prices and price competitively.""

and literally she would just stomp away from me.

If our arguments are more social issues, sometimes she'll just keep pushing strawman's or circular logic not for the sake of discussion, but to have the last word and I point that out so she's her aware of the fallacies, but it often just ends up with her getting angry at me, resorting to personal attacks to the point when i am emotionally affected and i start raising my voice and then shit just hits the fan.

We've been to a few session with our family therapist and my sister's main points she always brings up is

* `she doesn't feel heard`
   * when I ask her what does she mean by ""she doesn't feel heard"", because I do actually *listen* to her - **and respond**, she just repeats ad nauseam ""i don't listen""
* `that we all have our own beliefs`
   * we are not religious. when i respond, i am very clear if it's something that is ""personal opinion"" and when i am responding with something factual. and even if i respond with something that is personal (which aligns with her point that ""we all have our own beliefs""), she sees it as me responding *against* her.

And I would tell her that sometimes when we engage in conversation, she would always turn it into a debate - which to me I'm okay with, but it often feels like she's not really interesting in hearing in what i have to say (factual or personal) and instead, just wants to say what she thinks - and that's the final word.

The only thing our therapist has left us with is this : if things escalate, back out and take some time to breathe. We agreed.

Instead, my sister has decided to just...completely ignore me in the house. Refuses to acknowledge me. Literally walk around the house with headphones on and I can't even get her attention unless I literally go in front of her and ""wave"" (in which she shows annoyance). Even if I ask her a simple question like ""Hey, I'm off to the grocery store - do you want anything?"" she just snaps at me ""I'm fine I can get it myself"".

In the past, when we were very young, we've told each other that we wouldn't do this as this was something that our mother did to us that affected us psychologically. I told my sister how being ignored by my mom has made me extremely anxious to the point I have difficulty in social situations. She knows this and she has also been affected and we told each other that if we ever have issues, that we would never hold things in and that communication is what makes us close, so to see her cut off communication with me intentionally, hurts a lot.

Even during our therapy session, I've explicitly said how much this hurt me when my sister did this a few months ago where she ignored me for 3 weeks and it greatly affected my mental health - and I'm seeing her actually weaponizing this against me now. In all my times where I have been frustrated or upset with her, I have never done this passive aggressive shit towards her because I know how much it hurts.

In this current state where my sister refuses to even talk to me or acknowledge me, we cannot talk, therefore we cannot resolve any issues. I don't feel comfortable being in my living room. I don't feel comfortable eating in the kitchen. I've been locking myself in my bedroom this whole time. This passive aggressiveness is manifesting consequences in other forms.

My sister has been so important to me in my life, but seeing her purposefully hurt me when I told her ""hey, this really hurts"" has flicked a switch in my head. My sister has always had trouble processing emotions and from what I am experiencing, I don't think she wants me in her life anymore.

It's possible that I am not in the best emotional headspace right now, because her intentional passive aggressive is really affecting me. I'm in the process of selling all my belongings and my goal here is to just...leave without a word. With what she's putting me through right now, I just want to completely disappear and block her number and never have her reach out to me anymore. 

I don't know if there's something else I am missing or that I could be doing a mistake. I love my sister, but in my past experience with relationships/friendships, when someone doesn't love you for who you are anymore, that's it. You can't force it. You can still ""keep in touch"", but the interactions are no longer authentic - it feels incredibly surface level and very often I ask myself ""why am i even bothering with this?"".

  **tl;dr**: During therapy, I have explicitly told my sister how passive aggressive silent treatment hurts me and affects my mental state and she is doing it purposefully now.

I (19M) am a jerk and scared of hurting my gf (19M),"We started dating a bit over a year ago, it was pretty random, we were in a class togather and basically we started dating overnight with not much pre-relationship contact. I admit it and feel awful about that I went into the relationship without liking her and thinking that I was going to like her eventually (she had all the reasons for me to like her). Some time pased and i thought we were doing great, I believed we were in love until suddenly over one week last december I started doubting my love for her and that led to me fully believing we were both going to be better without this relationship, and regreting having started this whole thing.


Now i am posting this on reddit probably to just get reassurance to break up, and the reason I havent already was because I was scared, I know how much she loves me and I do really love her and i couldnt help myself if something happened to her (she often did say to me that she doesnt know what to do with her life if we break up). The thing that makes all of this worse is that I know how much she suffered during her past relationship when she was cheated on and I just dont want her to go through the same thing.



We are still young and hopefully everything will be okay I just want to hear from someone other that this is the right choice.


And how am I supposed to do it I have no idea

My(29F) boyfriend(30M) have difficulties maintaining conversation.,"My partner and I have been together for 2.5 years and I feel like conversations with him are boring and largely one sided. I feel like he engages minimally, if at all, with any topic I bring up. He rarely asks me questions or follows up on events in my life. I feel like I have to contribute more effort to engage in topics he has higher interest in or else we wouldn’t be able to talk about much. 

I have brought this issue up to him several times over the past 9 months and he doesn’t seem to understand the severity of how this is impacting me in the relationship. I feel often unheard, like what I say doesn’t really matter and most of the time I feel like I am talking to a wall as he often has zero response to what I say. He often just switches topics or he will repeat exactly what I just said back to me without any of his own personal insight. I feel frustrated, I resent him for his perceived lack of curiosity and I feel myself holding negative views of him. I often see him as being less intelligent than me as he can’t seem to engage in simple conversations without being prompted. I don’t want to view my partner like this, I love him as I think he is a good partner outside of this issue. I very much want this relationship to work out but I feel as if I am exhausting what steps I can complete without his effort. 

He feels as though he has ADHD that prevents him from attending to discussions and I have encouraged him to seek medical support to either be assessed or get treatment but he has been putting that off. I looked up tips to support a partner with ADHD and auditory processing disorders but I feel like I need his involvement in order to actually make any notable difference. I’m not ready to give him up but I can’t be in a relationship where talking to one another is such a struggle. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

TLDR; Bf and I are having trouble communicating effectively and I feel often unheard in the relationship. ",4,1l793tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l793tt/my29f_boyfriend30m_have_difficulties_maintaining/
my (21f) mom (45f) is extremely pessimistic + has a very depressive outlook on life and it's suffocating me,"my mom's entire life has just been one big shithole. I spent my entire childhood feeling sad for her. It started from her marriage. She and my dad have had a terrible relationship, she got married to him when she was 18 even when she didnt want to. She pretty much hates him, and rightfully so I guess cuz hes always been a shitty husband. She had TERRIBLE in laws who she had to live with. Then my parents moved away from them a decade into their marriage so it was slightly better but they still never stopped bothering her. and my parents never stopped getting into the worst fights, that has always been a constant.

She has had a TOUGH life. I spent most of my life feeling so incredibly...guilty? 
Everything I did would be an attempt to somehow please her or make her proud or happy. She wanted to study/work but couldnt so she's a housewife. She doesnt have a friend circle. She's masking infront of people 24/7. No hobbies, no activities. doesnt watch shows. Just spends her time doing household chores and cooking.

She has never done anything for herself. I used to feel so bad for her but now? I feel frustration. With time, it has only gotten worse. At this point she doesnt even bother to hide how miserable she feels. She has talked about how nothing makes her happy, nothing to look forward to. My dad has only made her feel worse. 

for YEARS now, everytime I sit with her, all she talks about is her past. I am not kidding. She has repeated the same stories about the same people, everytime. She'll ruminate so much. and tell me how much she suffered. how my dad was so shitty to her. She'll talk about her miscarriages and always implies that she's devastated that she doesnt have sons. (ever since I was a kid shes been asking me to pray to god to give me brothers. spoiler; no brother) 
she'll talk about how she didnt want to get married, she couldnt continue her education. shes not professionally stable. no one did this did that etc. 

its a lot i know.

let me be clear, my mom loves me a lot. shes sacrificed so much for her kids. shes always cared for us, given us the best she could. Yeah I'm traumatized because of my parents' marriage but thats another thing. shes always done everything for us. but now I sometimes dont even feel that affection from her anymore. 
She will say the most negative things to my face, not even considering how it may affect me. and its been this way for years. I always listen. 

Everytime I try to be positive, to give her a better outlook, she has another negative response ready. 
I am. so tired. I'm TIRED. I know it sounds selfish. I know it sounds bad. But I cant explain what its like having to comfort your parent when it should have been the other way around. Not once in my life can I remember her ever saying ""dont worry its gonna be okay"" about ANYTHING. For her, its always the worst case scenario. and she makes sure I listen to it. 

I dont want to live my life this way. I have dreams. I have aspirations. I am a firm believer that even if you have a shitty husband, your life is your own responsibility, you can still make a good life for yourself. Tbh I guess my mom knows this too, which is why she has always prioritized my education and that I become financially stable on my own. I'm grateful for that. 

but my point is, life shouldnt be a constant pursuit for success. it shouldnt be a constant struggle so you can just have a job and get married. YES those are priorities, but you can do all that WHILE living life as well. She couldnt do it and maybe its too late for her. But does she keep forgetting my life hasnt even started yet? 

why is she imposing those same pessimistic ideals on to me? why does she make me talk to her for hours on end about worst case scenarios and negative outcomes? why does she never talk about anything else, like what show did you watch, or how's your friend, or have you learned a new hobby, or ANYTHING. fuck. just anyhthing. 

I cant change what her life was like and how it changed her as a person. I know shes so full of love but life has been cruel to her. I just...I'm at a loss. I dont know how to deal with this anymore. It feels like everytime I try to advocate for happiness or positivity, she shuts me down to bring me back to ""reality"". Today she said ""you're too overconfident"" because I was telling her that we can make things work. What the fuck else am I supposed to say? that yes mom I'll spend my entire life fucking miserable and depressed and just study, get a job and then get married to some chump? What does she even want from me. 
God i know its not her fault. shes not abusive or. shes just...how she is. But its breaking me now. 

**TL;DR:**
**My mom’s had a very hard life — a toxic marriage, abusive in-laws, unfulfilled dreams, and years of emotional pain. I grew up constantly trying to make her happy and carrying her emotional weight. Now, all she talks about is her suffering, her regrets, and worst-case scenarios. I love her and know she loves me, but her constant negativity is draining me. I’m tired of being the emotional support when I never got that in return. I want to live a hopeful, fulfilling life, but it feels like she’s pulling me into the same darkness she’s stuck in — and I don’t know how to deal with it anymore.**",4,1l77ndb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l77ndb/my_21f_mom_45f_is_extremely_pessimistic_has_a/
"I (27M) let a childhood friend (27M) stay over for a week, but it’s been 5 weeks now. I want him to leave without being rude.","
I recently reconnected with a childhood friend I hadn’t spoken to since we studied together till 5th grade (around 2006). We’re both 27M. After moving to a new city recently, I invited him to meet up. He agreed and came over to my place. I didn't realize at first, but looking back, it felt like he was checking out my place for convenience.

A few days after that, he asked if he could stay with me for a week. I said yes. It’s now been 5 weeks, and he hasn’t moved out.

He doesn’t spend a rupee on food or groceries—even for himself. I pay for everything, and while he does cook sometimes, I still have to help. He doesn’t contribute to chores unless asked. He said he’ll leave when his parents come to visit, but they likely won’t. Now he says he’ll stay until the end of this month. I’m not okay with this.

He keeps claiming I’m his closest friend from childhood. But truthfully, we weren’t that close. It feels manipulative. I even lied once, saying my parents might come to force the issue, but it didn’t help. I don’t want to be rude, but I really want him gone.

How do I ask him to leave in a firm but respectful way? I want my space and peace back.

"My boyfriend (23M) prioritizes a female coworker at parties, and I (23F) feel disrespected and unsure how to rebuild trust","I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for four years. Recently, he insisted I attend a party that I wasn't keen on going to. During the event, he barely spent any time with me, instead dedicating most of the evening to talking with a female coworker.

At one point, I joined him and sat beside him, but almost immediately, he called over this coworker, patting the space between us, signaling me to move so she could sit next to him. This left me feeling embarrassed and hurt.

He insists there are no romantic feelings involved, but his actions make me feel otherwise. This isn’t a one-time occurrence; he has acted similarly at previous parties with the same coworker, despite me clearly expressing my discomfort.

I feel deeply hurt and disrespected to the extent that I'm seriously considering ending the relationship. He thinks I'm overreacting and says he won’t bring me to parties anymore because of how I am reacting.

I want to trust him, but I feel like that trust has been broken. I don’t know how to set boundaries to limit their time together since they work together, and he refuses to stop attending social gatherings outside of work.

How do I move forward in this situation? Is it possible to rebuild trust when I feel like I’m being pushed out instead of reassured?

**TL;DR:** My boyfriend (23M) repeatedly prioritizes a female coworker over me (23F) at social events, despite knowing it upsets me.

Me (f21) and my friend (m23) took the next step and since then things have been complected. I don’t know if he feels for me in a deeper way. Should I say something?,"TLDR;
My and my family have taken the next step in our relationship with a one night stand but it felt deeper than that. Since that day he’s been hanging around me a lot more and making comments regarding future plans ect almost as if he’s trying to see if I agree on those. I’m at a lost on what to do while falling more in love with him as they days go on. 


Me and my friend have known eachother a long time now and have always had a good relationship/freindship. Recently he’s been talking about his future plans with me and going into deep detail, about kids,house plans,future wife. What’s out of the ordinary is he doesn’t normal speak about this stuff let alone with me.

Now here is where it gets strange, a few months back a night out just the two of us ended in him staying the night and it was fun. It felt a lot deeper than just a one night stand and he made some strange comments, while having a debate he said “if we were together, I’d expect nothing from you Id just want to provide for you and expect loyalty back” he backtracked shortly after and said “it would be the same for anyone I’m with” he then ran off to the toilet for about 10 minutes. But there’s been more comments along those lines recently with him taking me up about a shared spaced offered him a while ago he said “I only took it to be closer to you” then backtracked and said he was joking.

Now this has sent my brain into a spiral because I really do enjoy his company and have always felt a strong connection to him. He’s always been quick at responding to me ect which is also out of the ordinary for him haha. We’ve always been flirty with eachother and always had the best relationship but it seems like it’s getting more serious recently. He’s always hanging out in the shared space to chat for a little longer ect even when he’s got things to be doing.

I called him the other night while I was going through a difficult time and he came right over to me and sat with me till the early hours. He goes above and beyond to make sure I’m okay and honestly I think I’m falling in love with him. But not sure if I should say something with the risk of ruining the relationship?",1,1l76l8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l76l8j/me_f21_and_my_friend_m23_took_the_next_step_and/
"My [25M] girlfriend [25F] of 6.5 years just isn't meeting my emotional needs, and our beliefs are really clashing now.","For context me and my girlfriend of 6.5 years moved to the states 2 years ago for our grad school, she didn't really want to study but she did not want to do long distance. We live together and we share a savings account and we've been through couples therapy and we had plans to marry. She grew up in a conservative Christian household.

I broke up with her twice (for hours) because she won't speak my love languages (which are all 5 tbh). Every time I have a talk about it with her she says ""I will try my best and it won't happen again."". Last week when we had this talk she said that again and I asked her what's the point of saying that if you have to keep repeating it, then she proceeds to say ""If it happens again, you can leave me and I won't stop you."" which broke my heart. Now, she still doesn't show me love other than cooking for me, which makes me feel like being taken for granted and she is too comfortable. I always try to do my best and I keep asking her if I need to do/change anything because I thought I was doing something wrong, but she always says that I'm doing everything she wants.

She never plans any dates, never initiates sex, never buys me anything. When I try to talk about them she always gives me a random reason like ""We are tight on a budget"" but I told a lot of times that a piece of candy would make me happy then she would give reasons like ""I haven't been to the store today."". Once I was talking about feeling like harming myself and she said ""When do you not"", I called her out on it and she said she was joking.

Lately my opinions about some ideologies in Christianity have been changing, two of those 'new' relevant opinions are 'no one will go to hell' and 'it is okay to be gay'. My gf is semi-homophobic and doesn't agree with me which is bothering me a lot because **LOVE IS LOVE**. If it isn't my gf /wife it wouldn't matter to me if we have difference in opinion in such strong matters. I asked her what will she do if our future child is gay, she said 'she won't raise her that way'. I also asked her what if I came out as bi she said ""I don't know, I won't think about it because I don't want that to happen"".

Every time we talk about our difference in opinion she talks like she is the right one and how disappointed she is in me because feels like I'm ""going away from the Lord"" and that she is praying that I will change, but somehow she also says that she is not bothered with our differences. If I don't feel like going to church it is very scary for me to tell her because she makes me feel shrunken and devalued.

I've been thinking about breaking up with her for months but I'm scared that it is not the right thing to do. But she once said ""I don't believe in remarrying after divorce"" which made me concerned about our future. I find it hard staying in this relationship hoping that it will go away but how long do I wait? How can I leave her after she moved to a different country leaving her family for me? I still love her despite all the reasons she is still a great person.

Can I even consider ending things given the emotional neglect, our clashing values, and the big sacrifice she made by moving here? How do I even begin to navigate this, and is it fair to leave someone who moved countries for me, even though I'm so unhappy?

**TL;DR:** My \[26M\] girlfriend \[26F\] of 6.5 years consistently fails to fulfill my emotional needs, even after talks and therapy. Our growing differences in core beliefs, especially about LGBTQ+ acceptance, are causing a lot of pain.

I (25F) feel guilty about lack of chemistry with guy (27M),"I (25F) have been dating a guy (27M) since February this year. He does most things right which is refreshing and after coming out a narcissistic relationship, I have never felt calmer. However, of course there’s always a catch…I feel like I have very minimal chemistry with this man. When we text it’s mainly functional or when it isn’t, there’s isn’t much meaningful conversation happening, mainly because he prefers ‘in person interaction’ but where I’m only seeing him once a week, it’s not enough time to me to build a meaningful connection if we don’t text playfully or have calls or anything like that. He is also quite stoic as a person, whereas I imagine myself with someone who’s playful, likes to mess about and have a laugh.

I kind of felt the lack of chemistry in the beginning but thought to give it a chance because I have come out of a relationship where I’ve had very high highs and very low low’s so it could be that that’s what I’m seeking, which is not what i want for my future. However, it’s only gotten worse and I don’t understand why! He ticks most of my boxes, he’s caring and considerate but it’s gotten to a point now where I’m turning down sex with him, kissing him isn’t fun, I don’t particularly miss him. Is the problem with me in this situation? Has anyone had anything similar and how has it ended for you? Will i regret ending it?

Caught between my family and my boyfriend and in desperate need of advice,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for advice or perspective on a really painful situation. 

I (20f) have been moved out of my parents’ house for just over a year. I didn’t leave on the best terms—my parents were constantly fighting, and it was taking a toll on my mental health and even disrupted my final exams. I felt I had to leave for my own sanity. My dad (50sm), however, believes I should’ve stayed to be their rock during that time.

He also feels that most of the fights between him and my mom over the years were because of me. He says I’d ask for something, bring it to my mom, and she’d try to make it happen without considering the bigger picture. He says instead of parenting, she was “just being my friend,” and that I’d manipulate her into going to him with things, putting him in a position where he either had to give in or be the bad guy. He says he’s felt steamrolled and like he never truly got to parent.

To be fair, I wasn’t exactly a stellar contributor at home. I wasn’t completely useless, but I definitely wasn’t pulling my weight either. I wasn’t taught a lot of life skills, and since moving out, that’s become really obvious. But I’ve improved a lot—I’ve taken on more responsibilities, I’ve grown, and my boyfriend has helped me with that. It’s part of what makes me cautiously (and maybe naïvely) hopeful that if I did return home now, it could go better than it did before.

Which brings me to the situation I’m in now.

About a month ago, I went to sell my four-wheeler. I offered it to my dad first but told him I needed full price. He declined, saying he didn’t really need it anyway. Later, when I got emotional about selling it, I called my dad—not to ask for help, but just for comfort. He misunderstood and offered to buy it under the idea of co-ownership, even though it was for significantly less than I needed. In the moment, I agreed.

After thinking it through, I realized I couldn’t afford that arrangement. I needed the money to pay back my boyfriend for helping me buy a new machine. If I accepted my dad’s deal, I’d be several hundred dollars in the hole and still owe more money on top of recent car repairs. So, I backed out. My dad seemed okay at first, but then on the day I was supposed to sell it to someone else, he called again and made another lower offer. I asked if he could come up $500, and that really upset him. I don’t blame him—I hadn’t communicated clearly and had gone back and forth a few times under stress. But it blew up.

This was the last straw for him. Even though things had been going better—we’d been visiting, watching hockey, and it finally felt like we were building a better relationship—he’s now given me an ultimatum: come home by Tuesday (my birthday), or we’re done. No relationship. He’ll treat me like a stranger.

My boyfriend (24m) however, says if I go home, he’s done. There’s no “maybe.” We’ve been together for two and a half years and he’s spent the whole time dealing with what he feels is constant chaos, emotional volatility, and unpredictability from my family. He says that no matter what’s going on, there’s always something new—some drama, some hidden motive or unclear expectation. And it’s worn him down.

He’s been cheated on, comes from a divorced family, and yet says nothing in his life has caused him more emotional stress than this. From his perspective, I’d be going backwards when he’s trying to build a future—and he can’t sign up for a life where my family is still pulling the strings or creating this kind of disruption.

I understand where he’s coming from, and honestly, I don’t blame him. My dad is very strict and traditional. Even if I came home and was the perfect daughter, I doubt I’d be allowed the kind of independence others my age have. For example, I don’t think he’d allow me to go camping with my boyfriend, which is something we love doing. I know comparison is the thief of joy, but when I look at friends who were allowed to spend weekends at their partner’s house or had supportive families, I can’t help but feel like I’m stuck in an impossible situation.

We even tried having my boyfriend call my dad to clear the air and explain some of the growth he’s seen in me. My dad was respectful, but it didn’t change anything. He said that even if the four-wheeler thing had gone the way he wanted, this ultimatum was coming no matter what—just because of the age I’m turning.

And now I feel completely stuck. Part of me feels foolish for choosing my boyfriend over my family. But another part of me feels foolish for letting my family’s dysfunction jeopardize a truly loving relationship and a bright future. No matter what I do, I feel like I’m going to have a very hard time living with myself. I’m terrified of waking up one day having lost one or the other, or both—and regretting the choice I made.

Has anyone else been caught between loyalty to your family and building a future of your own? If you’ve been in a situation where either choice felt like losing someone you love, how did you cope? How do you move forward when it feels like your heart is split in two?

EDIT: I realized I should’ve added this. I am a student. I do not have an income on which I can support myself. I rely on my boyfriend to help cover things so if I do not go home, there is this level of pressure on our relationship where it has to work out because I cannot afford to live on my own and now I can’t go back home to my parents if him and I do not succeed. 

TL;DR: I’ve been moved out of my parents’ house for a year after leaving under rough terms. My dad feels I abandoned the family and has now given me an ultimatum: come home by my birthday or we’re done forever. My boyfriend, who’s supported me and helped me grow, says if I go back, our relationship is over—he can’t handle the chaos from my family anymore. I feel like no matter what I choose, I’m going to lose someone I love. I’m torn between rebuilding with my family or protecting my relationship and future.

My best friend is getting married and I don’t think I like the person I become around her anymore,"I (31F) have been best friends with “E” (32F) since high school. We’ve been through everything.. moves, breakups, family drama. Ride or die. But over the past years.. as she been planning her wedding, something shifted... and I’m starting to feel like the worst version of myself around her.

She’s always been intense, a little controlling but lately it feel like she’s turned that up to 100. Everything’s about her timeline. She texts me at 1am about seating charts and gets passive-aggressive if I don’t respond fast enough. She makes these little jabs,like when I said I might not be able to make the bachelorette trip because of money, she said “Well some people prioritize what matters.”

I’ve started dreading her texts. I keep trying to hype myself up before seeing her, but then I feel small and snappy and bitter the whole time. I find myself being petty in ways I hate. I replay convos later and think, “Why did I say that?” or “Why do I let her talk to me like that?”

It’s not jealousy. I’m genuinely happy she’s happy. But I feel like I’m being sucked into her orbit again, where my role is to support, agree, stay small, and show up. And if I don’t, I’m “selfish” or “negative.”

I’m scared that saying any of this out loud makes me sound like a bad friend. She’s not a villain,she just stressed and excited and maybe kind of oblivious. But I’m realizing I’ve been minimizing myself around her for years. This isn’t new. It’s just... harder to ignore now that there’s a wedding dress involved.

How do you tell someone you love that being around them makes you feel worse about yourself lately? Can you even say that without destroying everything?

TL;DR: My best friend is getting married and has become super intense and controlling, and I don’t like who I am around her anymore. I’m scared to bring it up because I don’t want to lose the friendship, but I feel small every time we interact.

27M dating 26F for two weeks — unsure how long to wait for deeper emotional connection,"I (27M) started seeing someone new (26F) about two weeks ago. She’s a genuinely kind, thoughtful, and emotionally mature person. On paper, she checks nearly everything I’ve been looking for in a partner.

Still, I’m not feeling that emotional “spark” I’ve experienced in one of my past serious relationships. That particular connection was instant and lasted the entire relationship — and since then, I find myself comparing new relationships to that.

Because I’m dating with long-term intentions, I’m trying to be mindful. She seems like someone truly special, and it’s rare to meet a woman with this level of maturity and clarity. But I keep questioning whether it’s something that might grow over time, or whether the lack of spark is a red flag that I’m just ignoring.

Have any of you been in a similar place? How did you navigate early uncertainty like this in otherwise good relationships?

TL;DR:

I (27M) started dating a great woman (26F) two weeks ago. She has many of the qualities I’m looking for, but I’m not feeling a strong emotional spark. Not sure if I should wait and let things grow or accept that the chemistry may not develop.

I (23M) am very codependent on my gf (23F). How can I become my own person again?,"TL;DR: I (23M) am codependent on my gf (23F), and I want help with becoming more independent.

Hi, I (23M) have been with my gf (23F) for three years now. I realise I am very codependent on her, to the extent that I feel like i’m not my own person sometimes and that my life revolves around her. This has led to me neglecting other aspects of my life such as friendships and hobbies. This is obviously an unhealthy relationship dynamic and puts unfair expectations on both her and I. I think it stems from an anxious attachment style. 

Despite recognising this as a problem i’m struggling to come up with strategies or ways to deal with this. I can’t help but spend a lot of my time thinking about her and wanting to spend all my time with her. When I try and spend time without her and focus on myself I just feel like i’m forcing myself to be apart from her instead of genuinely enjoying my time without her.

Has anyone experienced this problem before and has anyone found successful ways to deal with it?

Should I (M60) cut ties with a long-time friend (M0) who's emotionally draining and resistant to help?,"I'm a 60-year-old man, and this is about a long-time friend of mine (M50) who I've known for many years.

For context, he’s from Russia and I'm married to a woman (F60) who is half-Ukrainian. Shortly after the invasion of Ukraine, he began sending me messages and videos that were strongly pro-Russian. I found the content racist and demeaning and asked him to stop. The conversation escalated, and I made a sarcastic comment about one of the videos, which led to him blocking me. At the time, I was relieved and thought that was the end of it.

Fast forward a few years, he reached out again last April to apologize and reconnect. I was cautious but open to reconciliation. I told him I forgave him, but trust would take time to rebuild. He tends to be long-winded and hard to understand on the phone, so I’ve kept communication to texts and WhatsApp since then.

Soon after reconnecting, he shared that he’s feeling lonely, going through relationship issues, and facing charges related to a domestic violence (DV) incident involving his ex. He insists he didn’t physically hurt her and blames the situation on a neighbor who reported him. He has an intervention order (AVO) that allows them to live together on condition not to drink. He has a PhD in mathematics and is highly intelligent, but he struggles with alcohol and tends to spiral emotionally, especially when intoxicated. I've seen this pattern before — it’s already contributed to the end of at least two of his past relationships.

At times, when drunk, he becomes angry and has made odd and unsettling comments to me in the past. Most recently, he said he was in a very low place and described it as “life or death.” I took it seriously and urged him to see his doctor, hoping he’d be referred for mental health support. Here, we have a program that covers several free or low-cost sessions with a psychologist. He dismissed the suggestion and mocked me for it, saying that depression isn’t a real illness.

I told him that mocking me for advice given in good faith was a boundary-crossing moment and that I was taking a step back for a week to give both of us some space. I encouraged him to reflect on how his behaviors affect those around him. At this point, I feel emotionally drained. My partner and I are already supporting someone else close to us who's going through a crisis, and I don’t have the capacity to be this friend’s emotional support as well—especially when he’s dismissive of help and unwilling to engage in change.

**So here’s my question:**  
Should I step away completely and block him now, based on this pattern and my own emotional exhaustion, or should I wait and see if he crosses another boundary?

**TL;DR:**

My (29F) boyfriend (31M) can’t seem to be himself around me.,"We have been together for 4 months now, but I still have a feels that he is unable to hold conversations well. He is very serious and technical even when we are chatting, even though when I tried to start conversations on topics that are light-hearted. And he doesn't seem to have a sense of humour while most of the time I'm trying to make things light-hearted by joking (the usual me - not that I try to be funny). I don't even think I recalled him making me laugh even once, and it's making our dates very dry. Most of the dates, I try to engage him but it's very one sided, and it honestly drains me a lot as I need to start and maintain the conversation. If I don't talk he would just end up looking at me without saying much and waiting for me to start another topic.

I did try to tell him about it but he just says he treats this relationship seriously that's why he puts on a serious front and is also an introvert. But to me, it feels like we are incompatible and that I feel like 4 months is more than enough time to be yourself. And truth to be told, ending the relationship has crossed my mind several times as I don't want to waste both his time and my time especially when I think it stems from incompatibility but also at the same time, I thought I should be fair to him and give him the space to open up as he mentioned this is his first rs. Part of the reason why I've talked to him about this is because I wanted to have a relationship that have open conversations and I want him to know how I feel.

At this point, I'm lost at what to do. Should I move on or give him time? Also, this relationship came from dating app, and it didn't really show at the start of the rs as I had more time and we would do activities together where there's things to do and we don't spend too much time talking. Recently I got busy with work and can only meet up for dinners where we have time to sit down over many meals and talk about anything, and that's when this situation shows up more often. And I always preferred people who can talk easily and have a sense of humour.

Tl;dr: I don't think we are compatible due to different personality. ",1,1l6ytfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6ytfo/my_29f_boyfriend_31m_cant_seem_to_be_himself/
"I (20M) think I am developing feelings for a very close friend (19F), but I'm not sure if she has similar feelings and am struggling to navigate it.","For the purposes of privacy, I'm going to refer to this friend in this post as Gemma, which is obviously not her real name.

Gemma and I have been friends from highschool since 2019, but we only really started to became close from around mid-2024. Our closeness then basically skyrocketed around the new year, as in December I was just coming out of an intimate relationship with a different girl that had utterly crashed and burned to failure, and Gemma was one of the main people (apart from my therapist) helping me through it.

From January, we really just started talking more and more frequently. By this point I didn't have feelings, but I was obviously very close with her already and, since I attend an online university and thus don’t have too much regular contact with most of my other friends, she quickly became my main source of social interaction. By March, when both of us were in the middle of our semesters at different universities, we'd gotten into the habit of scheduling times on certain days to call, and literally every time we called we would continue for over 3 hours, often past the time we would have originally intended to stop and go to bed. We could talk about virtually everything and anything non-stop.

We also then started talking more and more about sexual topics. I started sharing some of my own kinks and likes, she'd do the same, so much so that now sexual topics are almost a kind of inside joke of ours. We tease and lightly flirt with each other alot, we talk about things we've done sexually or would like to do, etc. She's even directly pointed out to me that she finds me hot and handsome.

Bottom line is, I feel seen and understood and cared for by this girl the most I ever have been by a close female friend. She's beautiful and understanding and caring and kind and funny and all the other things one-in-a-million types of people are. My therapist thinks she might have similar feelings for me, but I'm just not sure. I'm far too scared to confess because of how badly my previous relationship went. I just don't want to risk destroying such a good friendship. I know this sounds like a typical highschool crush (and it's not like it isn't that in some sense), but this really feels like something that could work out extremely well if we both have feelings. I'm just absolutely terrified of confessing because I have painfully fresh memories of my failed relationship from last year in my mind.

What do I do? Do I confess? Are there things I could look out for that might be evidence of her having/not having feelings? Do I maybe just wait and see what happens? What's the right way to go about this?

I (22M) am feeling insecure after multiple periods of no sex with my girlfriend (28F),"So this will be more of a rant type of post, as I feel like I've exhausted my options. I am pretty sure I'm just going to have to live with it, but I do feel a need to get this off my chest.

So I (22M) have been dating my girlfriend (28F) for about 2 years. Prior to us dating I was aware of a couple of her sexual partners as our lives never intermingled but were fairly closely occurring. Prior to us getting together she explains she was going through her Sexually liberal phase. She was sexually active with three men and immediately prior to us getting together she was sexually active with at least one of those people. I am completely fine and comfortable with this. I do understand people have a past and tbh it has nothing to do with me. I was 6 months removed from a three year relationship from my high school girlfriend, and we were both extremely clear about our pasts, sexual and romantic.

We had been hanging out together for about 3 days before we began to become a little sexual. She tried to pull my pants down and give me head. Thing is i have some sexual trauma from childhood  and as a result I really don't start feeling sexual attraction for people until I've built a emotional connection, so it wasn't really happening. I explained that at the time and apologized and she completely understood. We began dating without doing any of that until about a week later, we moved fairly fast and i got comfortable really quick.

We were relatively active but less so than i was used to as my prior relationships were pretty much every day if not every other day. Regardless I was relatively satisfied, but after about 3 months it became more infrequent. We would go a week or two randomly, that didn't really bother me as I figured it was fairly normal. We began to fight more as the responsibilities began kicking our ass. We moved in officially with each other and it got worse, I was fairly sure we would break up but we worked it out.

During this time we went about two months without any activity, this is when i first brought up the issue. We had a conversation that basically was an argument, she had found a lot of porn in my browser history, and was upset. I had informed her how long it had been and that I was sorry but it was too long for me. Her side was that she didn't realize, she was tired, and that i should've brought it up. We figured it out and it got better.

Fast forward a few months , she had started school and I was working a lot due to her needing to drop her job to focus on school. That time we made it a little over a month and I told her i was feeling ignored and a little insecure. previously she had an issue of me asking for sex in inappropriate ways, saying I would only grope her. So I brought to her attention multiple examples of me asking for sex in many ways (""groping"", being romantic, cleaning the house, straight up asking for sex) and then told her about how I was denied each time, which is kinda confidence shattering. We had a very hard conversation and figured it out, and it got better again.

Now about a month or two ago she started a new job, and I was working overnights. We made it about 3 weeks and I texted her at work and told her that I needed to talk to her, i clarified it was nothing she had done but more something i had been feeling and something I needed to inform her of. After dodging the convo for about a week, I finally told her. I was feeling insecure, i didn't want to compare myself to her past or anything, but it was beginning to become a little hard not to. I told her prior to dating me she was sexually active with three men, one of which we both knew was addicted to sex. It was hard for me to not feel like she didn't find me attractive or even ugly when i know she has been way more active in the past. I did end the talk informing her that it was more of something i needed to work on seeing as its an insecurity I had, and that i shouldn't be comparing.

We ended that conversation, and later that day i got relatively good news with my career. She then came to me and said she feels like my insecurity might've been coming from other career news that came months prior that kinda killed my self confidence. I felt really good and confident at the moment so I agreed.

Now we come to now, and we have not been sexually active for two and a half weeks. I have kinda made up my mind to just not for awhile, as I am feeling massively insecure of myself physically. I think if I am not gonna be active I would like to be in control of it and not just waiting until I get any opportunity with her. Ive also noticed that the last couple months when we did do anything I would always go down on her, and never the reverse. and that has been true since she did about six months ago when she woke me up to some but after about an hour I kinda lost it.

I don't know I think I'm just going to help myself, when I get alone time and keep it at that until it comes up again. It seems anytime the conversation does come up its from my end, and I'm just kinda tired of feeling extremely awkward and trying not to feel like a perv.

But I would like to know if I'm being unreasonable. Is there anything I could be doing?

TL;DR! I (22M) have been having issues with my (28F) girlfriend. We have gone through multiple long periods of no activity. We have had multiple different toned conversations regarding the issue. We are now nearing 2 1/2 weeks of no contact. I am just resigning myself to living with no sexual activity without another conversation about the issue. I would like to know if I am being childish, should I do more to have conversations about this?",1,1l6y65v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6y65v/i_22m_am_feeling_insecure_after_multiple_periods/
Boyfriend gets into weird moods around family,"My bf (41) and I (32) have been dating for almost two years. When we first started dating, he was super engaged and talkative with all my family at family gatherings. But the last few times we've been around my family, he's been super quiet and has a sullen and moody demeanor. Sometimes he'll barely say a word to me the whole time, and he'll end up snapping at me (it's reeeally subtle, and I don't know how to describe it other than that his voice is tinged with anger and it makes me not want to be around him, and it's over something so small). He's started isolating himself at gatherings and will just sit and stare into space by himself away from everyone. A couple of my family members will ask, ""hey, is Tim gonna come hang out...?"" And I'll just brush it off with some excuse, like, ""oh he's just tired from the drive!"" But the whole day beforehand he's lively and talkative and jovial - as soon as we start getting close to my family's place, he gets all quiet and weird and angry-looking. It's such a sudden shift, and it's like he's a different person, and I feel like I can't break through to him. Then the whole way back home, he is quiet and short with me the rest of the day/night, and hardly cooperative. I'll ask him a question and I can't even get a straight answer. Feels like I have to walk on eggshells around him.

The most frustrating part of this is he acts like everything is fine! I ask how he's doing, if he's okay, and he'll just give a forced smile and go ""yep"". I've tried pushing him to talk to me, and I've tried giving him his space, but either way he has never really acknowledged his odd behaviour. I almost feel like he was just trying to impress me when we first started dating, because he just acts so differently now. He is such a social and funny guy, it's so out of character for him.

It makes me sad. I wish he could enjoy himself with me and my family. It's always so obvious that he doesn't want to be there. I'm almost embarassed by it because I can tell my family notices, but they're good sports about it. As I catch up with family and play with babies and bond with everyone, hes just in a corner of the group and not engaged, or off by himself somewhere. I cherish these times with family as times where we build memories together, especially with new babies in the picture where they are forming their core memories. I'm starting to not see my boyfriend as someone who I could share a life with or have a baby with. Even though he's said he wants kids, I don't think the apathy he has towards the most important people in my life is a good sign. He also gets this way whenever we travel together. It just makes me not want to be around him. He's not like this all the time, but it's really important to me that we at the very least enjoy each other's company while we travel or hang out with family. But now it seems like we're pulling teeth. And I'm doubly anxious about his behaviour because he just won't open up to me about it.

tl;dr My boyfriend's been developing a moody and aggressive apathy during family gatherings, and he refuses to acknowledge it. It turns me off. A lot.",4,1l6xyyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6xyyt/boyfriend_gets_into_weird_moods_around_family/
Is it a red flag that my (24f) bf (26m) doesn't offer to help with driving?,"I moved to this country 1.5 years ago and I don't know how to drive yet. He knows I'm on a budget and trying to learn driving is sooo expensive.

Despite this he straight up said he can't help me because his car sucks. I think his car is just fine. It's a manual. Reasonable ig, it shouldn't bother me but it makes me a bit sad that he doesn't offer when he knows I'm struggling to learn driving on a budget and I don't have any family or anyone else as l recently moved here. Like I would have immediately helped him if roles were reversed. Is this fair?

Should I not be upset? I know I'm not entitled but it would be kinda nice to be with someone who wants to help me. We have been together almost a year.
My worry is, is this how he will be in the future with other things too? If it's not convenient for him will he never help me? Feels completely different than what I would do.

"I’m [28F] emotionally drained in my LDR with my boyfriend [27M] 8 months in and after finally meeting, I feel like I’m always the villain no matter what I do","TL;DR: I met my LDR boyfriend in person for the first time after 8 months, and while the trip overall was beautiful and full of good moments, the issue of sexual intimacy cast a heavy shadow. He couldn’t perform and blamed me, despite my efforts to be understanding. Since then, I’ve felt emotionally drained, like I always have to apologize and walk on eggshells. I’m starting to lose myself in this relationship and I don’t know if it’s still worth holding on.

Hi Reddit. I’m in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (27M). I’m (28F), based in Mexico. We’ve been together for 8 months, and in April, I flew to London to meet him for the first time. We planned and saved for that trip for months, and it was full of hope and excitement. I really wanted it to bring us closer.

And for the most part, it did. We had beautiful moments together. We went out, explored, shared laughs, spent time with his family (who were lovely), and had lots of quiet, cozy time just the two of us. Those moments made me feel genuinely close to him like we were building something real.

But despite all the good… I can’t stop thinking about the part of the trip that broke me: the issue around intimacy. It was the one thing that overshadowed everything else.

He couldn’t perform sexually, and instead of being able to process it together with understanding, it became a spiral of blame. He said I was too demanding, that I’m a “nymphomaniac” who only wanted sex and that I pressured him. From my side, all I wanted was to feel close to him. I wasn’t expecting mind-blowing sex or perfect chemistry right away I just wanted to connect, emotionally and physically. The bare minimum I hoped for was some effort to meet halfway. But that didn’t happen.

I tried to make him feel safe. I initiated intimacy gently, through kisses, cuddles, oral, trying to help him relax. But even when he couldn’t get aroused, he would sometimes push himself on top of me, using his full weight, trying to enter me when neither of us was physically ready. He would try to open me with his fingers and force himself in while still soft, and I had to ask him to stop because it hurt physically and emotionally. I’d sometimes push him off and tell him I’m not a toy you can just force open. It made me feel gross in a subtle but real way. And somehow… I still ended up apologizing.

Sometimes I’d wake up to him rubbing himself against me in his half-asleep. Later he said that was the only way he could “get it up.” I didn’t know what to say. It left me feeling invisible and confused. But even then, I still tried to understand him.

After the trip, we kept revisiting that topic over and over. I’ve cried, sent him long messages, videos, explanations, countless apologies. Every time I think we’ve reached closure, he brings it up again. “Yes, you apologized,” he says, “but YOU made me feel rejected. YOU hurt me.” It’s like I’m stuck in a loop, always having to justify my emotions, while he doesn’t take responsibility for how his actions affected me.

What hurts me the most is that it feels like this one aspect, has erased all the good from the trip. I treasure those nice memories we had, but now they’re tainted because he just can’t move past that part.

He later told me that maybe the reason it didn’t work is that he’s tall (over 6 feet) and I’m short (barely 5 feet), and we didn’t “position ourselves properly.” I honestly don’t know why this comes up now, a month later especially when I did everything I could to make things work without sacrificing my own comfort.

At one point he even said he had really high expectations for what sex would feel like and that being with me just… didn’t meet those expectations. That maybe he had overestimated what it would be like. That really broke me. He also said that because he was a virgin and this was his first time being intimate, he expected me to teach him everything but I didn’t know how to teach what I myself was just trying to experience honestly and gently. There are things you can only learn through time and trust. I don’t think it’s fair to put the weight of his disappointment on me.

Since coming back home, I’ve felt more and more disconnected.

We had planned a cozy online date recently in a game just something small to reconnect, since i've been busy this last couple of weeks. He even sent me a food delivery that morning and I felt hopeful. I was genuinely happy. I even listened to one of his favorite bands (one I normally avoid) just to feel more in sync with him. Then the trailer for Wicked 2 dropped (I’m a massive fan) and I got excited, started singing one of the songs during our Discord call.

His response? He groaned, started complaining about it, said, “Oh no, not this again,” and then muted himself. And then muted me too.

He literally didn’t want to hear my voice. I know it might sound small, but that moment shattered something in me. Singing is how I express joy it’s a part of me. And suddenly, I felt like even my joy wasn’t welcome. That I couldn’t be myself without being too much, too loud, too emotional. I wasn’t allowed to just exist freely in the space we shared.

Since then, I’ve felt… numb. Like I’m slowly disappearing in this relationship. I sacrifice so much of my time, my rest, even my identity to make this work. I wake up at 4 AM for work/school, stay up late just to talk to him before his work, watch his shows instead of doing my own things. My academic and overall performance has dropped. I support his passions, his frustrations, his hobbies. I put in so much.

He used to go to therapy, and back then I felt he was more grounded, more aware, more present. But since he stopped, it’s like he’s retreated inward again. When I tell him something hurt me, he says I’m gaslighting him. He went away to see a friend recently and didn’t even check if we had plans and when I said it made me feel forgotten, he told me I was overreacting.

I used to feel safe with him. Now I feel like I’m always walking on eggshells.

I still love him. But I don’t know if love is enough anymore.

Any advice, especially from people in LDRs or who’ve experienced something similar, would really mean a lot. Thank you for reading.",0,1l6x8az,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6x8az/im_28f_emotionally_drained_in_my_ldr_with_my/
My girlfriend (17F) is being overly possessive or controlling over who I (18M) talk to,"My girlfriend (17F) and myself (18M) have been in a relationship for about 4 months now, everything was going smoothly until a couple months ago , she's started to be really controlling and she doesn't let me talk to any other girls. Just recently I had to let my long time friend Em go because my girlfriend doesn't like ""other girls talking to her man"". Mind you, she has guys in her Instagram DM's and she talks to them on a fairly regular basis. But I can't have any female friends. 

Another thing she'll do is freak out when another girl looks at me on the bus or anywhere in public. I'm not a cheater and I never have been. I'm loyal to my significant other, and I've made that painfully obvious to her. I'm starting to think she's nothing but a control freak. 

TLDR; my girlfriend is being controlling over who I talk to, and she forced me to let go of my long time friend Em.",1,1l6wue7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6wue7/my_girlfriend_17f_is_being_overly_possessive_or/
I (18F) want to be a better person for my boyfriend (19M),"Sorry in advance for the scattered post, I'm new to posting on reddit and trying my best😭🙏🏻

My (18F) boyfriend (19M) and I are in a unique relationship, or so I like to think. We currently live nearly twenty hours apart (i.e. we're long distance), but we're together 24/7. As in, any given time during the day, we're in call. It drains the hell out of both our batteries, but we both adore each other's company so much that even when either of us has class or an obligation to complete, we mute and deafen and rejoice when it's over😭

This equates to eating, doing course work, sleeping, gaming, working out, all of it just in each others company.

Unsure if it's related, but recently I received a PCOS diagnosis, which really struck me down mentally after reading all the horror stories on infertility and pain and suffering after medication on reddit. To sum things up, my mood has been down for a couple weeks, and ofc, my sweetheart bf has shown up and read through all my labs and medical visits records with me.

He gets distracted really easily, though, and I had recently asked him to just put thought towards intentional spending time together with it only being us and no distractions for just a couple hours (was planned to happen yesterday, he spent all morning with his family outside the city and came back home to play video games for three hours with his friends and said he was tired as soon as he got off and went to sleep (I think he forgot ngl)). He also has a habit of (again, completely unintentionally) cutting me off during conversations and changing the topic to something completely unrelated that popped into his head. (Which I understand, ADHD gets bored eventually).

To sum it up, a bunch of different things just piled onto eachother and after silently crying over a few things every night after he went to bed over the past week, I finally took it out on him tonight in a long rant and told him I was feeling like the last priority in his life. He listened, apologized, and took accountability, and as did I for taking it out on him. He promised to do better and suggested ways we could progress communication in the future so that I didn't bottle up my feelings anymore. 

Now I'm lying on my bed feeling like a horrible person for getting mad at him and telling him he didnt care about me anymore in extended paragraphs of text. Of course, everyone has their flaws, and it isn't fair that I get to sit here and point out his for a couple hours while all he does is apologize. I'm certain I have flaws too, which is why I come to reddit to ask for your help and advice🙏🏻

What can I do to be a better girlfriend and improve my role in the relationship? This can be as general or as specific as need be. I want to be able to express my gratitude for him in ways, but am unsure how to, especially when we're long-distance but together 24/7. Things I can say or do to improve both his quality of life and subsequently mine. Thank you so much for any suggestions you can offer:3🙏🏻

My Bf’s(20M) ex warned me (19F) about him,"Hi! I’m 19F and my bf is 20M. I’ve been with him for about 6 months now but before that I had a long talking stage with him for about 8 months. Right before we started dating, i found out that he lied abt having an ex right before talking to me (i asked them who they were and he lied to me about who it was) they reached out to me and told me basically about their entire relationship, which included his red flags and such like how’s he’s neglectful and toxic and overall not rlly a great bf. i’m the type to usually listen to the woman because lowkey i always TRY to be cautious about these types of situations. when i did confront my bf back then, he didn’t deny but he also said that his ex was toxic as well, and i also heard that from other ppl. i ended up just concluding that they were just incompatible and both toxic in their own ways. but after that, i stopped being able to trust him emotionally and soemtimes physically. when we would have arguments i would think about it and bring it up because i would catch him doing the same behavior they warned me about. he would argue back that i focused on his bad traits because of what his ex said and he asked me to not bring them up anymore or compare him to how he was bc it just hurt him so i did. i stopped thinking about as often and i respected his wishes. however, deep down, i feel dumb, i feel like i set myself up bc it ended up happening to me too although it’s not like i’m super unhappy like i rlly do like him but emotionally our entire relationship has taken a toll on me. i have noticed he’s changed like in a good way i suppose, but even now i just feel so emotionally drained and no longer affectionate as i was before and i struggle alr so hard with intimacy. i want to be better. i’m just stuck on what to do, whether to stay? any advice would help

TLDR: My bfs ex reached out to me right before we started dating and told me that he wasn’t rlly a good bf and i chose to date him anyway. My bf has shown signs that what they said was true, and i can’t stop thinking abt it, but i stopped bringing it up in respect to my bf but i feel stuck. What do i do?

I just realized I can never explore my exhibitionist side in my relationship,"I'm a 32M and my gf is a 26F. We've been unofficially dating for two years (she's a family friend so we needed to be undisclosed for a while), officially together for 6 months
Sexually, she is always engaged and is the one who consistently initiates sex. She is very limited in her prior sexual experiences, so we've been trying things which she's only recently experienced for the first time. She remains conservative in a few aspects sexually. Let me be clear though, she's been exceptional with trying things in the bedroom, and I commend her greatly for that. She's very open minded and only requires taking things step by step which I completely respect and admire of her. The problem is me. For my entire life, I've always been an exhibitionist since as far as I can recall. I've always enjoyed being naked in front of others who were accepting of it. Things amped up in my last relationship though, where I openly explored posting myself nude (anonymously) on a nonpersonal snap account, in full support of my prior significant other. Without question, I was able to express myself entirely through anonymous nudity online and it never caused any sort of issues. After the relationship ended, I continued to post online but with less anonymity which was a phenomenal outlet for me.

That was 6 years ago..

Since January 2023 (currently June 2025), I have not explored this passion. Not because I'm over it (it's all I've wanted to get back to doing), but out of respect to my current partner who doesn't support me exploring my only possible option which is online. Please note, I don't resent her not accepting it whatsoever. I was hoping this never resurfaced and I'd eventually grow past it. This was never the case, unfortunately. Today was the realization that I'Il never get to act on this again, and it hit like a brick. I find myself in an actual panic, and it's been 3 hours of me reading up what to do in this situation. We touched base a few minutes ago and I expressed how difficult this is and how much of a panic l'm in now that it's setting in, and she was supportive while mentioning that she hopes this doesn't result in me breaking up with her. I assured her it won't. With all of that said, I feel hopeless, ashamed, embarrassed and pessimistic. But in reality, this was a giant part of my life. I don't know how to navigate through never having the ability to explore exhibitionism, and I understand how idiotic and nonproblematic something as seemingly small as this comes off. I believe it's truly affecting me as this isn't necessarily a sexual fetish, but rather an outlet (one that I don't fully understand), which provides me the feeling of satisfaction by embracing and displaying all of my deepest physical insecurities that have haunted me through insulting remarks and harsh words meant to hurt me from previous sexual partners or peers throughout my entire life.

I can't stress how aware I am of how stupid/
miniscule this seems, but it's a terrifying realization I've inevitably come to and I don't know what to do. Have any of you gone through this?? From an outside perspective, what can I do? How do I suppress this? How do I either cut this off or shut this part of my brain off? Am I a terrible human for this having side of me? Please let me know, if you actually managed to read this god damn novel. Thanks

Also, I booked a therapy consultation online for a clinic, so maybe that can help

26F Want to emotionally detach with boyfriend 25M??,"Me and my boyfriend has been dating for 4 years..we recently moved in together, we always fought over nothing which bothered me. Bought this upto him multiple times but he brushed it off saying people who love each other fight, you should be gald we are not fighting over big things. I grew up in a family were my parents almost never  argued, him quite the opposite ( his parents sometimes slept in different rooms cause of their long fights). The fights bother me cause I can't go to bed unless  it's resolved like literally can't sleep,  will sometimes spend the whole night crying, feels like my throat closing and eventually sleep cause I my body gets tired from crying, meanwhile my bf has no trouble sleeping or functioning like a normal person. Most of these fights are silly misunderstandings but talking doesn't really help either as most of the time when i try explain my pov he doesn't believe me.  I feel like I have to be the bigger person and apologise for something I did not do all the time, he feels the opposite. I literally can't function when we fight what do i do?

My boyfriend’s (19M) parents forced us to breakup. Should I pursue a secret relationship with him or move on.,"I (19F) have been dating my boyfriend (19M) for  6 months and his parents (41M and 40F) hate me, they don’t like when I come over to hangout with him, and they don’t agree when he comes to my house, due to the distance we live from eachother he usually comes home late (30 minute distance). For Christmas I bought them a gift card and they had told him that I was “trying to buy them off”. Fast forward a few months they now threatened to kick him out of their house, take his phone and car away (all which they pay for), if we don’t break up. We had no choice but to break up 3 days ago. Since then he came over today for us to talk more about it since we still are in love and are considering a secret relationship. He does go back to college soon so he won’t be living with them but his college is 3 months on 3 months off. I need some unbiased advice because I really don’t know if it’s worth it or not to get back together with him due to how toxic his parents are (but how close their family is with each other), and how much they interfere with our relationship.

TL;DR - my now ex- boyfriend’s family is very close with each other, but they hate me. They forced us to breakup off of that sole reason, but we’re still in love and are unsure if we should pursue a secret relationship (hide it from them) or not.

Am I (24F) asking too much of my long distance boyfriend? (37M),"So me and my boyfriend have been on and off long distance for 2 years now. He just got a job a few hours away from me (which is the closest we’ve been in a while) and I feel like he’s putting in no effort to talk to me. I’ve never felt like this before, I’ve always felt wanted and loved by him and we’ve been able to manage long distance before. He is rarely texting me throughout the day, he stopped calling me in the mornings and we only talk for about an hour at night before he falls asleep. This job also doesn’t have the best service but we got a starlink and he still rarely texts me. He tells me he loves me and that nothing has changed for him. He just keeps saying that his job is stressful and he’s really busy. Might I add that I’ve had 3 jobs for the past couple months and still manage to text him throughout the day and make time for him. Whenever I try to tell him I’m feeling unwanted or sad that we can’t talk and that I miss him, he tells me that I’m creating all of the problems and nothing would be wrong if I just “stopped being upset”. (I do have to say that sometimes I am a bit sarcastic and he doesn’t handle it well. I can def try to communicate better too) It feels like I don’t have a safe space to talk to him about my feelings and he just blows up with anger and tells me I’m the problem. He barely acknowledges what i say and doesn’t see anything wrong with what he’s doing. He hangs out with his coworkers all day and night and I just feel like a last priority. I have been really upset about it for a few days and it feels like I just don’t have a boyfriend anymore.

What can I do to make him understand and I am valid for feeling upset about this right? This situation is only temporary, he should be less busy with work in a few weeks but I feel like I’m compromising and being understanding for his schedule and he doesn’t try to put in any effort to make me feel more secure. Is that feeling something I should just do on my own? He’s kind of making me feel crazy and I know my feelings are valid but I need some advice pls Reddit

I [23F] am feeling lost and confused in my 6 year relationship with my [25M] fiancé,"For context, my fiancé and I have been together since 2019 and bought a house together two years ago. Both of our vehicles have each other’s names on them as well as other bills, save for our bank accounts. I love him very much but the longer we’re together it seems like he does less and less. I do all of the grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, etc. The only chore he has is taking out the trash (which only gets done when I ask, or physically bag up the trash and put in at the front door before he comes home). He also does have a porn addiction, while we are still intimate I have expressed how it bothers me many times and it’s still an issue. We rarely have date nights and if we do they are planned by me and he typically tries to invite his friends to come along. Any time I try to communicate my feelings to him he either blows me off or tells me I’m being ridiculous. I do enjoy doing the cooking and cleaning but it just feels like I’m getting nothing in return. I’ve been thinking about moving in with my parents for a while to give us space/show him I’m serious about needing a change but I would still need to help pay bills as he could not afford the live in our home by himself. I also worry about how we would separate everything if I decided to leave the relationship. On top of everything, his father and grandmother both have cancer and are going through treatment and I feel extremely guilty even thinking about leaving at this time. How do I go about this? Also, does anyone have experience separating assets/bills?

My (23M) GF (21F) wants a break.,"TL;DR
Girlfriend wants a break because she’s “bored with life.” She used to spend all free time with friends and party. Since moving/being with me her life has done a 180. She feels like she’s missing out on her early 20s.

To preface, gf and I woke up a few mornings ago without saying much. She said she wanted to go out to eat, but during the drive there I noticed she wasn’t acting like herself (being really quiet and dismissive). I asked her what was wrong and she said nothing.

We got home about 30 minutes later and she sat me down and told me she wants to go on a break. We’ve been together for 9 months and living together for 6. She moved 3 hours away from home to be with me. Prior to us, she used to spend all of her free time with her friends, partying, being around the wrong crowds, etc. Since living with me her life has done a 180 and really all she does is go to work and go home with the occasional visit home for friends. She told me there’s nothing wrong with me or our relationship, but she doesn’t know exactly what’s wrong. She said she’s bored with life and the monotony of her life now, but she can’t pinpoint exactly what she’s missing. She said she wanted to wait to have this conversation until she figured it out, but after thinking it over for a week she couldn’t find a reason and just decided to tell me. This completely blindsided me. We have felt a slight disconnect for the past month or two. We would both just go to work, sleep, occasionally go out. We haven’t had sex in a month, and the time prior to that was almost 3 months. She said this boredom with life and disconnect is one of the reasons. 

We didn’t explicitly decide what the break would entail. Are we still exclusive? Can we still talk as friends and go out for fun? Do we still say things like babe, baby, and I love you? We still live together and will for the foreseeable future. She told me I’m 4 times more respectful and treat her better than any of her exes. She also said if this was one of her prior relationships she would’ve just broken up, but because she loves what we have she’s willing to take a break instead of giving up. 

Just today I also noticed she stopped sharing her iMessage location with me.

How should I frame this conversation and lay down my expectations? Being exclusive is my main request.  I do believe she still loves me and is committed to a future, but I’m beyond scared that she’s going to spend more time in her hometown, party, be with friends, and decide that that’s what she wants and not settling down with me. She said she just graduated high school a few years, turned 21, and feels like she’s living like a 40 year old with no excitement that she should be experiencing in her early 20s. Which I don’t understand because she always talks about buying a house/land and starting a family over the next few years.",0,1l6sx93,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6sx93/my_23m_gf_21f_wants_a_break/
"my boyfriend says I'm the problem, am I?","my (m22) boyfriend always say I (f22) am the problem, am I?

hi reddit this may be a long one but I'll try to keep it simple as Ige never wrote a reddit post for advice before so bare with me. and try and write it unbiased 

for back story me(f22) and my boyfriend (m22) got together Jan this year, at first the relationship was great but red flags started popping up, it first started with small arguments like most couples would have such as making more time for each other ect.

our first proper argument was really petty he said that I enjoyed heartbreak  music too much and it was a red flag considering we are together. (he genuinely blocked me over this for 12hours) 

our next argument was because when I first met his friends they were asking me about celebries and I said in agreement a few  celebrites was attractive  ( I understand how this may be an issue and I apologised saying I was just trying to get along with his friends and I tend to mimic due to crippling anxiety which he knows about and my only common intrest with them was music   but  not an excuse I know I probably shouldn't have done it )

. but this argument was him having a full mental break down over the situation, grunting getting fully frustrated saying he's disappointed in me. I stayed quiet the whole time from fight or flight and he spoke to himself for an hour straight getting very heated 


next was a situation where I didn't want to wear particular clothing of his choice for the bedroom ,  I expressed how I feel uncomfortable and stuff like that isn't for me. he asked me to find a middle ground and that I can pick the clothing and he will pay.  I then said I'm still not comfortable and it will more likely cause issues in confidence in an intimate situation for me,  he said I hurt him and disowned his kink and that I was being unfair by saying straight up no instead of finding middle ground.

after this discussion/argument he said he has a list of things for me to change/ work on, such as ""not saying no straight away and discussing things instead (being a team) and that he wants to be heard and not dismissed""
when I asked if he needs to change anything in his opinion he said he will not sleep on arguments anymore


now we get to recently 5 months in we have had another arguments where I said I had boundaries in intimacy of things im not comfortable with and don't want to do, he called me blander than vanilla.  I expressed how having boundaries isn't bland and that it's healthy to know what I want or not.
this argument got heated as to him I was dismissing the idea again not compromising when I said that I'm very sure I will never change my mind on the matter. from this he left me on read all night and went to sleep  which was the one thing I wanted him to change 

he also got angry that if I send a screenshot to prove I never said something he thought I did that it's degrading him, he said I should say instead ""I'm sorry I made you feel that way it wasn't my intention"". but sometimes I genuinely feel like I need to show him I never even said similar to what his brain thinks of me saying 


. This has been my most recent convo with him and the next time he wants to meet he wants me to sleep over his.

there's a few issue with this that our arguments has caused me to feel distant in a way, I also feel uncomfortable sleeping over due to anxiety issues and the fact 4 other people live in his house.



I would just like to end this post with that I know commenters might  say to leave him but I genuinely love him,    the day he asked me out  he drove hours to see the stars with me,   he makes effort driving an 2 hours total to see me I know  deep down he cares about me, I know he's not cheating or doing anything like hitting me or worse . I guess maybe I wish he could mature and think about my feelings

any advice is greatfull good or bad welcome i will take all into consideration 

I definitely left out alot of more situations but you get the idea 



TL;DR  my boyfriend may be a manipulator but I think i may be too blind to see, I think sometimes I'm at fault but this amount is crazy



//UPDATE

thank you all for your support and kind words. you have opened my eyes that I wasn't imagining alot of things and that it's worse than I thought. I will be planning a way of leaving.  I just will need some time to emotionally prepare and think of the best way to word it so that he doesn't try and guilt me into staying as I'm very emotionally attached.

so I will be taking time to finally detach from the situation maybe using a method I saw on Tiktok ""gray rock""  until i have planed out the final escape

again thank you all   this is will definitely be awful emotionally but I know there will be light the other side once it's over ❤️",0,1l6svj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6svj9/my_boyfriend_says_im_the_problem_am_i/
How to stop my girlfriend from overthinking?,"Me (16m) and my gf (17f) have been dating for just around 7 months. Me and her have had some rough spots in our relationship because she overthinks so much because of her past relationships. She had been used and verbally and a little bit physically abused by her last 2 boyfriends and its taken a huge toll on her mentally. She overthinks any tiny action I do and makes it a huge deal because she things shes messed up and that I'm gonna leave. I always re assure her that I wont but she still thinks that.

 For example, tonight we built some legos and watched the movie the notebook because shes been wanting to watch it even tho she pretty much knew the ending and all that stuff. I had not seen the movie so I was trying to watch it and since she knew what happened and stuff she got bored and wanted attention. She would try to kiss me and stuff which is fine but I would then go back to watching the movie because at this point I had to see what was happening and stuff. This kept going on and on and it got to the point where she once again overthought it and thought I didn't love her. I would try to get close to her and reassure her but she would push me away.

 Idk what to do because its gotten to the point in thr past where we've almost broken up and I dont want thag to happen because I genuinely love this girl. Please help

Wife (F24) and I (M24) are in an impasse when it comes to kids but the divorce won’t be mutual.,"The marriage is fundamentally broken. I’ve been unhappy for about a year, realizing many things.

She is essentially asexual, and will only have sex with I beg and beg. She’s activityly told me that she’s just not attracted to me, but that she isn’t really attracted to any men. (Or women lol I asked that)

She wants to settle down. She is ready for kids and to start looking into a home. I want to explore the world. I want to try teaching overseas, go on long trips abroad and move away from our parents. (Lots of trauma there lol)

But now the biggest one. I don’t want kids anymore. When we got marriaged two years ago, I was excited at the thought of living like my parents, having lots of kids and staying in a small town forever.

But I was 22 when we got married, and I’ve changed. I need sex. I need freedom. I need to leave this town. I don’t want kids. 

I know what most people will say. How the hell did two totally incompatible people get married??? Well she was my first girlfriend and after a lot of childhood trauma I was willing to do anything to prevent someone I loved from leaving me. 

Now, I’m unhappy and with someone I’m totally incapatavke with. We get along just fine. But when I’ve voiced my concerns, she brushes them under the rug or says it’s my mental health talking. 

After a year and half of begging (of our two year marriage) she is finally coming to therapy with me because she knows I’m considering divorce. 

But I am so stuck. The more I feel like we grow away, the harder she clings on. She suddenly wants to cuddle every night. She suddenly wants sex. Suddenly she wants to spend every single waking second together.

I can’t do this. The harder she clings the more suffocated and stuck I feel. 

I want her to see what I see. She wants kids more than anything in the world. And I don’t want the same future. But I’ll have to be the bad guy.

My relationship feels like a friendship?,"For some context i’m 21(F) and he’s 22(M) and this year we will have been together for 5 years. We started our relationship very young but for the most part we’ve had an extremely healthy and loving relationship and i care for him very much.

I know since we’ve been together so long we’re grown very comfortable within our relationship but i feel as though at this point we’re more platonic than intimate. We’ve had problems with sex in the past i rejected him a lot for a period because my libido was really low on the bc pill and that really affected his confidence. Now i have my libido back but he’s not interested in sex really. We probably have sex once every 3 weeks and it’s really frustrating me. 

He doesn’t flirt with me or make me feel as though he’s sexually attracted to me and i feel like i have really low self esteem and confidence because of it. I talked to him about it yesterday to see if anything was affecting him but i didn’t really get and answer but he said he will try more and he does think im attractive and enjoys the sex we have but i just find it hard to believe. 

I don’t really know what to do because it’s really hurting me that he doesn’t show any interest in that way is there any way this can be solved?

TL;DR, Partner and i have been together so long i feel like we’ve lost our sexual attraction for each other and our relationships more platonic than intimate. Any advice?",3,1l6rdff,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6rdff/my_relationship_feels_like_a_friendship/
I (20M) read a hurtful text message about me on my (19F) girlfriend's phone that I shouldn't have and now l'm not sure what to do?,"For some context my girlfriend and I have been dating for around 3 months now and in those months our relationship has been going pretty well without any major problems.

Before we dated her and I became friends through a community college volunteering club and after a few months I caught feelings for her. She was beautiful and extroverted and because of my insecurities I couldn’t see her feeling any romantic feelings towards me since compared to her I am pretty average. Although I assumed she didn’t feel the same I still went through with it and was met with the answer I expected. She didn’t feel the same way about me because she was scared from her previous relationship and said I wasn’t fully her type. However she said she enjoyed my presence and even told me that she had to prevent herself from catching feelings for me. She wasn’t ready for a relationship but still wanted to keep spending time with me and I decided it was worth the risk to keep seeing her even if she may never feel the same way about me.

What followed was a month of mixed signals from her and uncertainty about her feelings. It was hard to deal with and there were times were I questioned myself about what to do. However, things did eventually change and we did end up together. We fell for each other hard but I still couldn’t shake this insecurity of not being up to her standards. Although our relationship seems great now there are times where that feeling comes back and one day I couldn’t shake it.

I’m not proud of this in any way and I hate myself for this but I was left alone with her phone open and I decided to search my name in it. I scrolled down the conversations and what I found hurt me deeply. It was a conversation with her best friend during that month of her figuring out her feelings for me. In the conversation her friend called me ugly and my current gf didn’t deny that if anything she agreed and said something along the lines of “if he was more good looking I I would’ve locked in with him months ago”. I was left with so many mixed feelings reading this. I knew I wasn’t her type but reading something like this hurt me because it touched the insecurity I held about myself since before we started dating.

When we started talking she would rarely compliment me or flirt with me and now that she does that so often I ask myself if it’s all just a facade. Why did I have to work so hard for her to find me attractive and see something in me? If it took so much to change how she sees me how do I know she won’t change her mind? I know I shouldn’t have read that but now I don’t know how to ignore this or even talk about it with my girlfriend without destroying the trust. Is this something I should bring up? Or do I learn to come to terms with this?

TL;DR: I’ve always been insecure since I find my girlfriend more attractive than me and I have know that I am not her type so I went through my gf’s phone and now I regret it because I saw a message of her calling me ugly before we dated and now I am not sure what to do about it.

(M35) Caught girlfriend (F31)in longstanding lie and debating if I need to break up or not.,"Lately, I've been really bothered by something in my relationship. Early on, I didn’t talk much with my girlfriend about boundaries. One of mine is that I don’t feel comfortable with my partner meeting male friends one-on-one for dinner or drinks, especially late at night.

A few months ago, she went out until 3 a.m. with a married male friend. I later told her that made me uncomfortable, and I explained my boundaries clearly.

She assured me that was the only time it had happened during our relationship. But I went back through our messages and found several other times she had gone out one-on-one with male friends — something she denied repeatedly. I confronted her, and it took 30 minutes of pressure and showing proof before she finally admitted she had knowingly lied. Her reason? She was scared I’d break up with her.

The lie itself wasn’t even about the boundary — it was that she lied multiple times and only came clean when I had undeniable evidence. Now I’m left wondering what else she’s lied about. It really damaged my trust.

So, Reddit, what would you do? Can a relationship recover from this kind of dishonesty if it came from fear? Or is the ability to lie like this a red flag I shouldn't ignore?


TL;DR:
My girlfriend lied multiple times about hanging out one-on-one with male friends, saying it only happened once. I later found messages proving otherwise and confronted her. It took 30 minutes and solid proof before she finally admitted she lied out of fear I'd leave her. Now I’m struggling to trust her and wondering if the relationship is salvageable or if this kind of dishonesty is a dealbreaker. I did not tell her I was uncomfortable with meeting male friends one on one until a later situation happened. So it wasn't something she went against an established boundary. But she did deliberately lie about it, after forgetting she had previously told me herself about those other meet ups.

Started comparing new relationships to my high school one—7 years later. Advice?,"Lately I’ve (26F) been thinking a lot about my high school relationship that ended 7 years ago. He was truly a great boyfriend—kind, funny, and genuinely obsessed with me (in a sweet way) & would’ve done anything for me. We had so much fun together and laughed constantly, and I really did love him. He wanted to try and make it work long-distance when we went off to college, but I ended things early on in college because we were at schools 6 hours apart and I wanted to meet new people and fully experience college. I know I broke his heart. 

Now, years later, I find myself comparing the guys I date to him. No one seems to measure up to how I felt back then, and it’s starting to mess with my head. I don’t want to be stuck in the past, but I can’t shake this feeling. Has anyone else gone through this? Any advice?

How to make sure conversations don't awkwardly stop,"i (17f) and my bf (17m) have been going out for 5 months, when we message our conversations definitely aren't that good but i'm ok with that seeing as i don't really like to text, i never felt that way when we face timed or met up in real life though.  However we just finished a face time and i feel like we didn't have much to talk about, and at times it was a bit quiet and boring. I know silence is good, and i enjoy it, but conversations used to flow and im scared that soon when we meet in person I'll feel like we can't talk at all. 

I know it sounds dramatic but i think this is because I always seem to have this issue where im really close to someone, for example a best friend, but one day it just seems like i can't talk to them anymore, and i have to do things like force myself to laugh at jokes i know i would've found funny in the past, or force conversations and then the relationship/friendship dies out. I'm so paranoid because it always happens, so i want to make sure i can nip it in the bud sooner rather than later. 

I just need some advice to make sure i can try to stop this issue before i feel like i randomly one day can't speak to him. I love him and don't wanna lose him because of my weird and sudden inability to speak.  Thanks!!

TL;dr, I want to ensure conversations don't awkwardly fizzle out because i'm scared that's starting to happen and it's happened in my past. I appreciate any advice!",2,1l6py8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6py8x/how_to_make_sure_conversations_dont_awkwardly_stop/
Advice Concerning Commitment Issues,"so I (M21) started dating my girlfriend (F20) about 4 weeks ago, and it’s been going great. we both like each other a lot and are looking for very similar things in a partner. the thing that has been on my mind however, is that she told me she has always had commitment issues and is worried she will get scared and try to run away as we continue to get closer. her willingness to tell me that is a good sign that she wants to work on it, but it’s got me anxious that i’m going to move too fast and push her away. what can i do to help her feel safe and not pressured/overwhelmed?

How can I rebuild trust in my boyfriend again?,"I have been daying my boyfriend for about a year and a half and up until this point we haven’t haf any real issues. Yesterday morning I (17F) went through my boyfriend’s (18M) phone while he was sleeping. I know I shouldn’t have but I needed it so I could find my phone after I dropped it and the sudden urge to do so came about. I really only looked through his messages and found two conversations that put me off and had me like um wtf. The first was him telling his bestfriend that he might talk to some black girl he took home and then saying ‘nah I can do better than that’ so then I kept looking. Another message with a different friend came up about said friend’s graduation hangout and they were talking about girls. The friend asked my boyfriend if he was trynna pipe and he said ‘is that even a question’ and saying that out of the four girls they were talking about he would take two and the other friends can have the others. That’s what really threw me off so I woke him up and confronted him before I left work. We talked about it for a little while and he basically said he knew he was never gonna do that but was just going along with his friends, not thinking about what he was saying before he said it. I mean I for sure know that he hasn’t cheated on me because we’ve consistently been together and when we’re not I know where he is and he knows where I am, and he’s not the type to hangout with his friends all the time over being with me. After talking about it I know I’m not gonna breakup with him over it (Im set on this), but I guess my real question is how do I rebuild my trust with him after that? I want to get back to the point where Im not overthinking about what he said or if he’s gonna do anything related to what he said. Like he knows that if I find out anything again we’re over and he acknowledged that what he did was wrong and im ngl i let him dit there and cry and feel bad about it in my room while he went to work, like yes feel like a terrible person. And although Im not necessarily mad about it I just keep thinking about it and idk what to do.

TL;DR: boyfriend said things to friends insinuating disloyalty but he hasnt physically cheated, how do get trust in him again? I want to feel secure in our relationship but I don’t know how to fully get back to that without being controlling.",0,1l6p85y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6p85y/how_can_i_rebuild_trust_in_my_boyfriend_again/
My (37M) wife (37F) has developed a strong relationship with a gaming friend (40M). I’m not sure how to handle this.,"My wife (37F) lost her job several months ago (thanks Elon) and has been struggling to find anything since. Her job is very functionally specific so it has been difficult to transition into new areas. We talked about the possibility of this previously and I make a livable income, so that part isn’t a big issue for us. I would be fine if she didn’t want to work anymore. She’s looking though.

But also, she has been spending a lot of time gaming lately. She got sucked into World of Warcraft and is getting more and more of her socialization needs met through online gaming. A few months ago she met this one guy who clicked with her personality and they have been playing more and more ever since. She has spent upwards of 10 hours on the game with him some days although usually more on the lines of 2-3 hours per day. They mainly play while I’m away at work or late at night so it doesn’t really interfere with our life together but the amount of time they spend together on the game is shocking to me to say the least. 

Things progressed from there and they have moved on to other games like call of duty and baldur’s gate together. They also started texting each other and I have seen her texting him all hours of the day.

At this point, I snooped because I needed to know if anything was going on behind my back. I looked at texts and there was some mild flirting on both sides. Nothing extremely inappropriate though. Both commented on each others looks and there was several comments about how much they enjoyed each other’s company. The pictures sent seemed like normal things like food, interesting places we had gone, and a few selfies. The guy did tell her he thinks he is falling for her but knows nothing could happen. He also sent some poetry that he said he made for her. Knowing her, I could see her vomiting a bit in her mouth over that but her response was more like, “awww, thank you for that.” I could see her probably saying that just to be nice. He also made several comments about how he feels like Lancelot talking to Guineviere and I was Arthur. Really odd in my mind but she didn’t comment back much and I saw several messages with her telling him how much she was in love with me. I know some messages could have been deleted but also have no reason to believe they have. They talk all the time while gaming though, while I’m away at work and also while I’m there. She doesn’t seem to hide much though and tells me when they play and talk.

We’ve talked about my feelings about this several times and every time she acknowledges it, cuts things back, but a week later, everything is back to this same situation. Overall, our lives and our relationship is great though. We get along wonderfully, the spark is still there, we spend time together, and are happy. I just can’t shake the feeling that whatever this is with her gaming friend has either turned into something more or will soon.

She says that she doesn’t want to cut ties with him because their friendship has developed into something extremely important to her. She would if I asked though. I don’t want to be that person that asks or controls her because I feel she would resent me for it and not be happy at all. If I don’t ask her to, I fear this could develop further and even if they don’t go in the direction of a romance, it could still affect me and how I feel. 

A few other important details: This guy lives about 15 hours away, so I’m not worried about physical infidelity.   She has acknowledged to me that he might have developed feelings for her but outside of really enjoying his company, that hasn’t happened on her side. I do play games with her too, but don’t have much time because of work. I think he has some sort of night job, so he can spend a lot of time with her while I’m at work. 

TLDR: My wife is spending a lot of time with a gaming friend who is developing feelings for her. She says it’s not a problem, but I see it differently. I’m not sure what to do. 

  
UPDATE: Thanks for all of the excellent advice everyone. I will plan out some time to talk with her tomorrow and see what we can agree on. The advice here has made me realize that this situation is important to cut off but also that it sounds like I need to make sure her mental well-being is taken care of.

Should I [M18] stop seeing my friend's older brother [M23]?,"Hey, I’m looking for some advice because I have no idea what to do here. I’m 18 (gay guy), and my best friend Maddy (also 18) has been in my life since I moved to the US from the UK at 15. She was my first real friend here, and she’s still my closest one. Her mom’s been like a second mom to me too—  I have even stayed for extended periods of time at their house when my parents have gone back to the UK for work reasons.

Maddy has an older brother, Logan (23). Didn’t really know him at first because he was off at college, but I saw him around a bit. He’s tall, super athletic, and at first I kinda assumed he was your classic jock and I was kinda intimidated by him. Also, not gonna lie, I had a bit of a crush on him even though he had a long-term girlfriend and seemed very straight. I never told Maddy, obviously. I usually tell her everything, but yeah… not this.

Anyway, after college he moved back home and I started seeing a lot more of him. Turns out he’s not the dumb jock I assumed, he’s funny, sweet, and really kind. He would tease me a lot, about being scrawny or asking me when I would get a boyfriend, but in a jokey playful way. Maddy started dating someone, so I saw less of her and more of Logan. We even started hanging out just the two of us. He started taking me to the gym and we would go out for food or to the movies. He’d talk to me about his breakup, and I tried to be there for him, even though I suck at relationship advice lol.

Then one day he told me something that shocked me, he said he thinks he’s probably bi, and that he had a crush on a gay friend but was scared to tell him. I tried to be supportive, even though it hurt. I told him he should go for it. And then he said… it was me. I was the guy. I was completely floored, but also over the moon. We’ve been seeing each other since.

His mom found out eventually and was super supportive about it and even said she kind of suspected something. But we tried to hide it from Maddy for a bit. When she found out, she lost it. She said dating a friend’s sibling was totally off-limits and disgusting, and that if we didn’t break up, our friendship was over.

Now I’m stuck. I don’t want to lose Maddy—she’s been like family. And maybe she is right? Maybe siblings should be off limit and I crossed the line. But I also really care about Logan. I had one relationship a couple of years ago and it was awful. I don't know if emotionally abusive is too strong a term but my previous boyfriend would always criticise everything I did and call me stupid and tell me nobody else would ever be interested in me. I really started to believe that and thought I would never have a good relationship. But Logan is so the opposite of that. He is sweet and kind and is always supportive of me. I would hate to lose that.

So yeah… I’m just kinda lost. Is Maddy right? Did I totally cross a line here?

tl;dr: Started dating my best friend’s older brother. She found out and is furious. Not sure what to do.",0,1l6olmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6olmq/should_i_m18_stop_seeing_my_friends_older_brother/
How do you make it so a new relationship doesn’t feel like an old one?,"     Hi! So this is kind of a weird question but one that has been on my mind. I (16M) got out of a 5 month long relationship 2 and a half months ago. It is important to note that the relationship that ended 2 months ago was my first one. I am in the process of moving on but that’s not important. Basically, for those who have been in multiple relationships, how does it not feel the same as the one(s) that came before? Like I understand how it would feel different emotionally and mentally because it’s a completely different person and you think if everyone in a different way, but what about physically? Like when you hold hands with a new partner do you just think about how you felt holding hands with the previous partner? I didn’t have sex with my previous but we did some basic teenage stuff like making out and similar things. I feel like this is maybe just a time heals all kind of thing, or maybe because I am young and she (17F) was my first relationship. But if anyone can give some input that would be great, thanks!

TL;DR: I don’t know how you can touch someone in a new relationship and not think about an old one.

I(18W)don’t see future with my bf(19M) and thinking about breaking up,"Sorry if post is a bit rambling, I don’t know how to explain in a better way. 

We are together for 2,6 years. 

I’m still thinking it’s just because of the stress or depression idk.

For the first 1,5 years everything was amazing. But since last spring he annoys me, I’ve started feeling that he doesn’t hear me. He always says that he forgets, or that I didn’t drop a word about something(but he’s still really caring and sweet bf). Speaking like he hasn’t living in our country for 11 years(my language is not his native), there’s always some mistakes in pronunciation or grammar(it was normal before he visited his dad), I tried to correct him but now I’m just shouting because I’m tired and he’s telling that he’s doing it for joke(I know he doesn’t)

Warning!!
we both are not working and living with parents 

I’m getting annoyed that he doesn’t have money for anything, birthdays of our friends, going somewhere at least buying some cheap game to play with our friends(so I’m paying for most of these things for half a year).
He’s from kinda poor family. His mother was an alcoholic and now she often changes men and his father didn’t contact him until last summer(he’s thinking that bf only wants money from him).

I’m having a few commissions for year and going to tattoo artist courses.
He’s is always telling me(for 1,5 year) “when i will get job…” but there’s ALWAYS a problem, no position on what he’s wanted, he needed to go to visit he’s dad in another country and other.

I feel jealous of girls who get flowers or some cute small presents at least few times a season(let alone dates). But I’m the one who gives presents, the one who paying in a restaurant mostly.

He finished school this year, because he didn’t know language when he moved so school send him back two grades. He passed exams(passed but results are terrible for me, hope that he could enter university). I know that his mom couldn’t pay for some extra private classes, but she paid for courses and he missed at least 50% of them because was ill. But he was ill that much because he was hanging out with friends at night being ill. And also he promised that he will prepare on his own(he didn’t).
And maybe because of his classmate who are younger, he act childish, and I tried to talk with him about it.

Now he’s again telling about “new job” and that he’s going to buy me a printer for tattoo(after a lot of promises I just don’t believe but waiting). I’ve already got money but saving them, maybe he will buy.

Thing that annoys the most it’s his style in clothes. He telling that he’s just a punk, but he looks like a clown(in a bad way, not good like he presents). I gave him some advices what to wear to look good but all he do, that’s wearing his grandma glasses, a lot of rings(he usually accidentally hitting me with them). I’ve already asked him not to wear them near to me, but what I hear? “It’s part of my personality, I can live without them”, he told that even when I told him to took them off because he will get problems on exam.

Maybe it would sound selfish or arrogant but I want relationships where I could receive 1-2 flower bouquets per month and 1 date planned by partner at least.

I’m just scared that I will be alone, because he’s the only person who supports me in my drawing stuff and always telling about our sweet future where I won’t need to work and could waking up with breakfast ready and that’s the person who I can call if I have panic attack at night. He’s lovely but stupid, childish and annoying as hell.

We’ve been talking about breaking up at the start of autumn because he was rude and cold being in his dads place and was jealous about every single person(but didn’t tell to stop hanging out), and I felt exhausted because of first year in university.

There was plenty of situations him being rude and selfish but he always cried asking to forgive him. And when we are talking about breaking up, he telling that he will change, but that didn’t really happened noticeably.

"27F, he’s 35M — only dated a few weeks but he talked about me meeting his mom, then said he wasn’t ready. What kind of behavior is this?","

I was seeing this guy I got introduced to through a mutual friend. From the start, he made all these future-oriented comments — not just light ones either. At one point, he literally told me, “My mom needs to learn English to meet you.” (He's Hispanic, I’m not.) That felt huge. He also said things like “If you fall in love, I don’t mind,” and made it seem like something real could grow between us.

At the same time, he kept contradicting all that with things like “I’m not ready for emotional depth,” and “I don’t really know what I want.” It was a total emotional push-pull. His words were vague but romantic, while his actions were intimate and suggestive of something serious — yet he’d back away from actual commitment when anything real came up.

Fast forward to after we ended things — someone I know (a friend/acquaintance) started talking to him flirtatiously. He told her straight up that he’s only looking for fun, casual dating, and that his job doesn’t allow him to have a romantic relationship right now.

So why wasn’t he that honest with me? Was it because we had a mutual friend and he wanted to save face? Or was I just someone he wanted to keep around with “emotional breadcrumbing” until something else came along?

Also worth noting: His Tinder profile says “short-term relationship, maybe long.” I feel like that sums up his whole vibe — emotionally vague, just enough to keep someone hooked.

So… what kind of behavior is this? Avoidant? Emotionally manipulative? Or am I just overthinking someone who was upfront in his own way?

TL;DR: Dated a guy (35M) for a few weeks who talked about future stuff like me meeting his mom but also said he wasn’t ready for emotional depth. After we ended things, he told someone else he was just looking for casual fun. I’m confused — is this avoidant, manipulative, or just immaturity?",6,1l6o83l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6o83l/27f_hes_35m_only_dated_a_few_weeks_but_he_talked/
Help! I (25F) feel resentment towards my partner (29M),"I (25F) have an amazing boyfriend (29M) that I love so much. We have been in a romantic relationship for a bit more than 3 years. But these last year, I noticed I get more resentful with him.

I started to notice this feeling some time ago last year's summer and I expressed it to my bf. At the moment I felt like he barely wanted to go out with me and do something different other than watch a film or a series at his place. He changed for a bit and asked me to still invite him to do new stuff too every now and then. Let's say it has partially changed, considering I have been busy for the last month studying for an exam. We don't go out at lot but at least a bit more.

But last month and this month has me suffering mentally, which makes, I think at least, everything more emotional and hurtful for me.

Last month I asked him also to help me bring a matress from my friends place from another city (we both live in different cities) and we coordinated a day together. But the week of the plan he apologized because he overplanned the day with car deal appointment (a plan to make money which I liked). It made my anxiety worse since not only I had to coordinate some stuff in my shared apartment but also another date to pick up the matress from my friend's. (Note: I couldnt carry it myself, that's why I needed help.) But at the end he picked it up himself and left pretty fast from my place because of parking issues.

Now this weekend we have a holiday on Monday which means a longer weekend. I got excited when I found out and I asked him about his plans for the weekend. I expect him to work on Sarurday on his normal job or random 2hr shifts in his second job. This time he was helping his cousin with his car and since his cousin came from far away, we agreed for me to go to his place on Staurday afternoon/ evening. Now. the car parts he needed for the car repairment did'nt come until I guess Saturday. So he told me we couldn't see me this weekend.

This made me feel so angry and sad, and **dissapointed**.

I told him I felt sad but I knew it was out of his control. Because *yes, I know he didn't choose for this to happen.* But I am sad, leave out alone with expectations once again. And I tried to distract myself from the fact I feel like this because part of me knows and understands I shouldn't feel like this.

But I can't, once again I feel resentment building up on me, I feel betrayed and abandoned. I feel like not a priority to him when in fact, he does a lot for me.

He is caring and listens when I talk about stuff that makes me feel sad and stressed. He gifts me stuff just to lift my mood. He is a caring person to his loved ones (friends and family) and hardworking.

But this feeling of resentment makes me want to push him away, I don't want to see him and act like he didn't hurt me. I don't feel like talking to him. I remembered all the times this last minute change of plans happened, mostly because of his work and some stuff out of his power.

I am aware that from my last experiences with men I have some anxious attachtment, but I feel like I am developing more a distant attachtment. I am tired of being hurt and feeling stupid because he is allowed to make mistakes and things happen. I don't know how to express this without hurting him.

  
TL;DR I feel resentful towards my partner because the last two times he promised something he didn't follow because of his fault or extern issues. How should I express this to my bf without hurting him?",1,1l6o410,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6o410/help_i_25f_feel_resentment_towards_my_partner_29m/
I (17M) confessed to my crush (17F) and now I’m not sure what to do,"I (M17) have had a crush on this girl (17F) in my friend group for a while now. We’ve known each other for about a year, and recently we started a Snapchat streak, it’s been going for like 20 days. We talk here and there, mostly small conversations, and things felt like they were going somewhere.

Anyway, we were both at a party yesterday, and I decided to just tell her that I liked her. We talked for a bit after, and at one point, she said she likes another guy (also 17M) who I describe as “more handsome” than me.

I told her that if she likes him, she should go for it. I just needed to be honest and tell her how I felt. I also said I respect whatever she decides. She told me she’s not sure how she really feels right now.

She left the party not long after. Today I messaged her apologizing if I made things awkward or put her in a weird spot by telling her. She replied saying it was fine.

We’re still snapping, but it’s mostly dry snaps now. Even so, we’ve got the golden heart on Snapchat (best friends). But earlier today, I saw she reposted a TikTok that said:

“You can’t make someone love you. You can try to convince them you’re worth it, but you never get the result you want. We spend all of our time trying to get someone else’s attention, convincing ourselves that if we care enough, eventually they will too. By sheer willpower alone, I can make someone love me — but no matter how hard you try, love is one thing that you can’t force.”

At first I thought she might have posted it because of me, like maybe she felt bad about not liking me the same way. But then again, part of me thinks it could actually be about her feelings for the guy she said she liked — maybe she feels like she’s trying to win his attention, and it’s not working. Honestly, there’s no way to know for sure, and overthinking it is driving me crazy.

Now I’m just confused. I don’t know if I should keep trying, give her space, or move on. I really like her, but I don’t want to make her uncomfortable or keep pushing for something that isn’t mutual.

⸻

TL;DR:
I (17M) told my crush (17F) I like her. She said she likes another guy but isn’t sure about her feelings. Now things are awkward, and she reposted a TikTok about how love can’t be forced — I think it might be about me… or maybe about the guy she likes. Not sure what to do next.

Summary:
We’ve been friends for a year and recently got closer (Snap streak, convos). I confessed my feelings at a party, she said she likes someone else but isn’t sure. I apologized the next day and she said it’s fine, but things have been kind of dry since. She reposted a TikTok about how you can’t make someone love you — could be about me, or maybe she’s feeling that way about the guy she likes. Either way, I’m lost.",0,1l6nqrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6nqrj/i_17m_confessed_to_my_crush_17f_and_now_im_not/
I (F20) do not desire to have sex with my partner (M21) but enjoy it when I do.,"Hi! Me and my boyfriend have been dating for over three years and we don’t have any problems. Communication between us two has always come easy, we don’t have any major arguments as there isn’t anything to argue about and overall we have good chemistry. I love him very much and can see a future with him.

At the beginning of our relationship, we had sex often. After a while, I went on the pill and taps between us having sex because larger and larger, it wasn’t until the gaps were a month- two months I realised that something was wrong. I do not want to have sex with my boyfriend, it’s not that I’m not physically attracted to him as I am, I just don’t have the desire to have sex. He initiates often but I often turn him down.

When coming to this realisation, I changed contraceptives but that still didn’t work. We have tried adding new things into sex but that hasn’t made me desire it anymore than I did. We have spoken about this numerous of times as it’s a big part of our relationship, he has said that it doesn’t bother him but it bothers me. I don’t want this to be the reason we drift apart or break up.

It isn’t that I don’t like sex, when we have sex I do enjoy it and afterwards I even want to do it more often but the want goes away after a week or so.

If anyone has experienced this or has any advice that would be appreciated!

TL;DR: my boyfriend and I have been together for over three years and have no problems other than sex. I do not desire to have sex but when we do have sex I enjoy it.",0,1l6njc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6njc8/i_f20_do_not_desire_to_have_sex_with_my_partner/
I (26F) told my partner I needed a mental break and he (25M) internalized it.,"Hey guys. I’m 26, marrying my partner soon, and suffer from bipolar disorder. I’ve been feeling irritable lately and stressed from school. I texted my partner today that I wanted to take a few days for myself to regulate my mood and feel normal again. I feel like he took it the wrong way and internalized everything I said. He calls me and asks me how I’m feeling. I told him I’m stressed and irritated; and I just wanted a break from communication because I didn’t want the rub any bad energy off on him. 

The call ends. I go to sleep after having a big breakfast. I wake up to 4 texts and 2 missed FaceTime calls. I finally answer because the second FaceTime call wakes me up. He says that if I need a break from the relationship then we need to just call it quits. I explained that I don’t necessarily want a break from the relationship but I just don’t feel like myself and he deserves me at 100% — not whatever *this* is. I got frustrated and told him to forget everything I said and that I’ll just suck it up. He gets upset and tells me I’m not communicating properly and he just wants to understand why I desire a break so badly. After explaining several times, he finally understood. I told him I would compromise and message him every morning and night before I go to sleep but I can’t guarantee communication during the day because I’m really not up for talking. 

After the second call ends, I get a sick feeling in my stomach. Am I not allowed time to myself in this relationship considering my mental illness? Was I wrong for saying I needed a break from socializing? I honestly didn’t want him to feel like I wanted to avoid him or the relationship but I tend to shut people out whenever I’m down because I’m concerned that I’m being a bad vibe. I’m just not sure if I was wrong for wanting this for myself. It feels like I’m pushing a boundary just to satisfy him.

TL;DR: Bipolar girlfriend wanted time to herself due to stress from school and irritability. Boyfriend internalizes it and we almost break up over FaceTime. Girlfriend comes up with a compromise to communicate twice daily, but feels like the compromise is pushing a boundary as she preferred to be alone during this time with no communication.",57,1l6lipy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6lipy/i_26f_told_my_partner_i_needed_a_mental_break_and/

is cleaning it out, and he starts singing this song by some dude (he made a bunch of viral songs on tiktok) he asks if i follow the man that made the song he's singing i say no, he says 'that makes it worse'....i ask him, 'makes what worse?' 


It took some bickering but he eventually admitted he had a problem with me reposting the video, I told him it's the same as him or someone else reposting a video about finding out someone they didn't know was the voice of a bunch of popular characters (and later I brought this up again, he told me I didn't say that earlier which I think was him gaslighting me)


I tell him that was weird and passive aggressive and then he says 'what if I just wanted validation?' then he tried to compare it to him hypothetically reposting a video about ice spice, and then he admits the problem he had with me reposting the video, was that he thought I reposted it because he thought I was attracted to the man, (mind you, I can't even remember the mans face.)
After he said that I brought up the fact that he's been watching porn behind my back for six years, and told him he was projecting onto me and that he started all of this because he thought I was thinking and lustfully as he does.

"Am I overthinking this relationship or is something actually wrong? (long-distance, gay couple)","Hey everyone,  
I’ve been in a relationship for the past 3 months with my boyfriend (he’s 26M and I’m 22M). We’re in a long-distance relationship, and lately I’ve been overthinking a lot. I don’t know if what I’m feeling is normal, if the relationship is healthy, or if I’m just reading too much into everything.

The biggest problem is communication. Since we’re far apart, staying in touch is super important. But I feel like I’m always the one starting the conversations. He usually sends me a “good morning” text, but after that he doesn’t really message me unless I text first.

Sometimes I see that he’s been online, but he hasn’t replied to me or even looked at the reels I sent. Most of the time he does check them, but other times it feels like he’s just ignoring me. I’ve been left on delivered for 6 hours before, and it makes me feel like if I didn’t text him, he wouldn’t text me at all that day. When I do message him, he does reply, but it’s often hours later and he never really starts the conversation himself.

On the other hand, we do FaceTime every night. He’s always the one who calls, and we talk for more than an hour every single day. That part makes me feel good, but outside of our nightly calls, it feels like he has no communication habits at all.

This relationship being long-distance and gay doesn’t make things easier either. I keep having this feeling that something is off or that he’s not that into me. I can’t shake it. I talked to him about how I feel, and he told me that he just doesn’t like texting. He’s also working a lot, around 13 hours a day, and has to cook and clean by himself. He’s an immigrant and really overwhelmed. I do understand that and I try to support him as much as I can. When I text him while he’s at work, he usually replies.

But still, my main issue is him being online and not messaging me back, or replying way later. I just want to know if I’m wrong for feeling this way. Am I being obsessive? Or is this a sign that he’s not really interested? I’d honestly be fine if this is just how he is, I just want to know if this kind of communication is normal in a relationship or not.

Thanks for reading. I really needed to let this out.

**TL;DR:**  
My long-distance boyfriend and I talk on FaceTime every night, but he barely texts or starts conversations during the day. I often feel like I’m the only one putting in effort. He says he’s just busy and not a big texter.

My [19M] situationship [19F] has just gotten a boyfriend and I don’t know what to do. Any advice?,"TL;DR. My FWB told me that she wasn’t ready for a relationship then got a boyfriend without me even knowing. Now I don’t know what to do.

For context, I 19 M have known (we’ll call her Jane) for four years and have been best friends since high school we have recently gone to the same university, and as of four months have been casually intimate with each other. Nothing major, just some kissing and heavy petting. She both said she was not ready for an official relationship and that was the reason why we were not officially together.

Yesterday, I asked Jane if she wanted to hang out this weekend, which was usually what we did at weekends whether it be going bowling, going to a bar or just chilling at each other’s accommodation. She said that she was busy and I asked what she was up to. She said she was seeing a friend which I immediately thought was strange as we have the same friend group and she would normally state the friend by name. This morning I woke up to a text saying this… “Plus um well now dont freak out but I do have something to tell you” Then she dropped the bombshell. “I have a boyfriend, and I’ve been with him for about a week now”

This hurt me immensely, I do truly love Jane and was under the impression that we were not together because of shared circumstance and that we would wait for each other. What hurts even more was that we had seen each other a week previously and had been intimate. So if what she says is true then she saw him and made things official the day after she last saw me. To make things worse, she sent me a photo of them together. And told me all about him. I couldn’t help but cry.

I honestly just don’t know what to do. I feel unbelievably hurt and betrayed. This is triggered my inferiority complex and has made me think that our entire relationship was out of pity. I have no idea if I’m being entitled or just an ah. I could really use some advice.",0,1l6l15w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6l15w/my_19m_situationship_19f_has_just_gotten_a/
"My (35F) partner (45M) shuts down emotionally, lies about gambling, and gives me the silent treatment for days or weeks - I don’t know how to cope anymore.","TL;DR: Been with my partner (45M) for 6 years. I (35F) helped him after he left his marriage and supported him through a gambling problem, even gave him money he lost. Now he emotionally shuts down, lies, and gives me the silent treatment for days/weeks anytime there’s conflict. I’ve tried to be patient and loving, but I feel completely alone. He says I should respond more “nicely” to his mess-ups, but nothing ever really changes. I’m grieving, have ADHD, and feel like I’m slowly losing myself. Just need to know… is this something I can fix or am I dragging out the inevitable?

We’ve been together 6 years. We met at work - he was my boss (he’s not anymore), unhappily married at the time. After he left his wife, we started a relationship and he moved in with me. I own my house (mortgaged), and I’ve also taken on a parenting role with his two kids (now 12 and 7). It was rocky at first, understandably, with his ex and family stress, but I loved him and wanted to build a life together.

He told me before we started a relationship that he had a gambling problem. I’d had family members who struggled with it too in the past, so I tried to support him. I ended up remortgaging my house (my idea, I needed to free up some cash) and gave him £6,000 to clear debt. He gambled it all away in two days. I gave him more. He lost that too. I was hurt but weirdly calm about it - I just wanted him to feel safe and get better. I’ve paid a few mutually important bills for him since then but I haven’t given him any more money.

Since then, we fall into this cycle:

He secretly gambles, or lies about money or something small
•	⁠I notice his mood shift, and ask what’s wrong
•	⁠He completely shuts down, sometimes for days, sometimes for weeks
•	⁠I end up breaking the silence with affection and love just to get things back to normal

He says he feels attacked when I bring things up and that he’d open up more if I responded to his mistakes with softness - like calling him a “dafty” instead of being upset. He does acknowledge that this is virtually impossible but I’ve tried that too. Nothing sticks.

I’ve recently lost my Nana (we were very close), and I’m feeling incredibly alone. He can sit in the room while I cry and not say a word. If I mention it; he says he doesn’t know I was crying. I have no close friends, no therapist (can’t afford one), and don’t feel like I can tell my family the full truth.

I’ve got ADHD, was only diagnosed at 32, and I’m still trying to unlearn all the shame I’ve internalized over the years. So part of me constantly wonders if I am the problem. I’m not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. I smoke weed daily, have low self-esteem, and I can be a bit intense but I’m trying. I really am.

I do love him, and I know he’s been through a lot. His childhood was loveless, his family is distant, and I think he’s emotionally stunted. But I’m drowning in this relationship. The emotional silence is killing me.

We have a family holiday coming up (that we’ve paid over £4k for), and I’m worried he is going to have an episode before we go and I’ll end up having to pay for everything while we’re there. He doesn’t fight to fix things. He just shuts down until I give in and soothe him.

What do I even do with this? Is this relationship salvageable? Am I being unfair for needing emotional connection when I knew he was damaged?

Any advice or tough truths welcome. I just need clarity. 

Edit: thanks for the replies so far, just for some additional context, he always gives me money for bills etc on payday (50% of the bills) and always pays his child maintenance. He has self excluded from the bookies and I thought things were improving but recently discovered he had been “investing” which, to me, feels like a thinly veiled attempt to continue the same behaviours in a more acceptable package. It’s the lying/not telling me when he’s done something and then the silent treatment that follows that’s the main issue for me I guess.

Avoidant Help,"
Hello all I have a question to help me with clarity.

My partner and I got into an argument (me 36 and her 30 together for two years she is an avoidant attachment) two weeks ago. I was at fault for telling a fib (nothing crazy but still harmful and I totally understand that) about taking trash out when I didn’t and she caught me in it. Of course, I also understand that this kind of reaction wasn’t about the trash - it was most likely a build up.

They started saying “I don’t know if I can be with you anymore. What would you do bum position? You lied to my face!”

I tried to take ownership and she did say what I said was beautiful and I also made sure to let her know I would do better by her and myself in speaking with my therapist to stay accountable.

The argument started back up (no yelling or anything, just tense I would say) and she was saying she doesn’t know what she can trust me over.

As I’m at the door she says “I love you text me when you get home.” And gave me a hug. I ask if I have anything extra at the house before I go and she says “Well it’s not like you’re leaving forever.” And I was like, huh? She then doubles back and says “Well, I mean, you know if anything does happen I’m not gonna treat you poorly.”

I text her when I get home and own up to my faults again and sent flowers. I get a text saying “thank you they’re pretty”

A week goes by and I heard nothing from her (I also didn’t reach out for a week to give space) and then at midnight on my birthday she says “Happy birthday” I thanked her and said hope she was well and hope to see her soon. Nothing again.

On day 12 of not speaking with eachother (not sure if happy birthday counted as her reaching out)

I sent a text that was very light just saying when she’s ready we should have a light conversation about everything (because I’m currently in limbo. There was no break up - but yet again this doesn’t feel like a relationship with this much lack of communication)

Nothing again three days after that text but now checking my social media. I’ve given two weeks of mostly silence and space (one was a response to happy birthday and the other was about check in on day 12) I’m functioning currently as if we are still together since no one called it.

What is this? Is this an avoidant shut down and just wait it out?


TLDR: My partner (me 36, her 30, together 2 years) and I got into an argument after I lied about taking out the trash. I took full accountability, apologized, and committed to change. She said “I love you, text me when you get home,” and gave me a hug—so it didn’t feel like a breakup. I followed up with an apology text and flowers; she said thank you.

Since then, it’s been 14 days with no real communication. She sent a “Happy Birthday” text at midnight, and I later sent a soft message inviting a light conversation when she’s ready—no response.

We’re not “broken up” officially, but this silence doesn’t feel like a relationship. Is this an avoidant shutdown? What do?

I (42M) don't find my wife (45F) sexually attractive anymore,"I've known my wife for 25 years, married 14 years. However, things have changed in the past few years. We're both each others firsts, and we've never had sex with anyone else. I don't know what to do now. 

We used to have a very good active sex life when we were younger (of course). However, i feel that her libido has taken a nose dive in recent years. Whenever we have sex, which is about 1 - 2 months apart, I can't hold an erection. I have to somehow force myself, or create fantasies in my head to keep it up, and orgasm. I don't know about her, but she very commonly says ""you should cum, don't worry about me"". Which is very nice of her, but just shows her libido isn't there anymore. 

I have no trouble masturbating to porn, which i have to. My cycle is about every 3 days,  and i get horny. Morning wood keeps me up and i have to massage my dick. 

I'm not blaming her bad libido. I guess everyone is different. I guess it's come to the age where our sex drives are now different.  I always think that if I had married a younger person,  we wouldn't have this issue.  But that's beside the point. 

I worry that she'll discover i don't find her sexually attractive anymore. I don't know why. 

I always contrast her to a 30F colleague, in my mind.  I find this colleague very very, VERY attractive. Whenever I interact with the colleague, my heart starts racing and i blush really badly. We have a very good relationship, but we both keep it very professional. 

What do i do? How can i rekindle my sexual attraction to my wife? Or is this ""it""? As we age, the reality is that sexual attraction will eventually disappear? I forsee myself just taking care of myself with porn as the years go by. Which is sad. I feel i need to have sex. I do love my wife, and I think we're a good match. Except for the loss of sex and sexual attractiveness....

Any advice would be appreciated. Or just bash me. I don't know. Help.... thanks.....

TLDR: I don't find my wife sexually attractive anymore. Looking for advice. 

Edit: Seems my post has been locked, so thanks for the refreshing responses. I get the ""I'm an AH"" bit. I was just being honest and voicing my heart, as I had nowhere else. You all gave sound advice, and the overwhelming take I have is to talk to her about it. I'll work on it.

I (M18) found out my partner (NB-18) is upset with with my friend (F21) what do I do?,"My partner told me today that my friend makes them uncomfortable. We’ve been mutually friends with this person for a while, then my partner stopped hanging out with them as much. This was fine, I just hung out with them separately at different times. 

But then my partner found out my friend had a crush on me. I wasn’t entirely clueless to this, but it was kind of vague to me. I didn’t realize fully for a while that she really actually liked me. Neither of us were hiding it from my partner, but since we are polyamorous and very open, I didn’t (at the time) think it was serious especially since my friends feelings wouldnt wind up in a relationship for various reasons. I later realized I was being stupid and should have said something.

My partner was (very understandably) upset and cut off communication with my friend fully. 
I continued to hang out with them separately because my partner told me that it was okay.

Now it isn’t okay. My partner says they feel very uncomfortable with me talking about her, and while they assured me they didn’t want me to feel like I had to cut her off, it kind of feels like i should cut her off. 

It feels kind of like a lot of information there. TLDR; my partner doesn’t like my friend, but I don’t know how to just stop being friends all of a sudden. How do I go about this? Should I stop talking to her? Should I keep being friends and not tell her? Currently she doesn’t know how much discomfort she brings my partner. I don’t know how to bring it up.

debating leaving my LDR partner? F21 M21,"I (F21) am considering breaking up with my LDR partner (M21). We have been together almost 2 years, usually LDR across states but he’s currently studying abroad in Japan. There’s an 11hr time difference and I’m working full time so we haven’t texted/called much since he got there a week and a half ago. He says it’s because he hasn’t been able to get a handle on his schedule yet to talk with me. I have tried a few times to make plans to call in the mornings/nights but he has forgotten or been too tired each time. I’m trying to be understanding, but I feel like there’s ways around this scheduling conflict I’ve asked him to do (ex. texting me updates while I’m asleep, sending photos of his adventures, setting up a time to talk on the weekends) but none of this has happened. We fought about this issue and now it’s been four days since we’ve talked last. This may seem like a minor issue to some, but we are used to calling nearly everyday or texting frequently when calling isn’t an option. To paint a fuller picture, there are other issues we’ve had I’d like to list as reasons I’m considering a break up: 

-we fight frequently (1-2x per week or rarely more)
-he’s made unsolicited judgmental comments criticizing my diet, friends, politics, body hair, life choices, strangers etc (always apologizes but I feel like the comments will never truly stop)
-lack of goals/not future oriented, only real hobby is video gaming 
-online sexual relationship is barely there. he uses porn instead of engaging with me which I’ve brought up multiple times my issue w that. in person sex is alright but usually centered around him. 
-he has yelled at me twice over small instances/mistakes, which was a major deal breaker for me and strongly considered breaking up after that

Any advice/opinions/similar experiences welcome. I know at the end of the day it’s my decision and some people might say it looks you’ve already made up your mind. But he is my best friend and I love him. Thank you for reading and replying!

"I (18F) just moved in with my boyfriend (19M) and his parents, and I’m feeling really anxious and out of place","I’m 18 and recently moved in with my boyfriend and his family. I didn’t have a stable home growing up — it was just me and my mom, and we struggled financially. She dated a lot of different men over the years, and now she’s married to someone I don’t get along with and had a baby with him.

For the past 6 months, I’ve been dating my boyfriend. I used to vent to him a lot about how my mom treated me — she’d threaten to kick me out, expect me to pay half the rent, and get mad at me for using basic things like the laundry.

One day, kind of out of nowhere, my boyfriend told me his mom said I could move in. I didn’t even bring it up, so it was a surprise. But I’d been spending a lot of time at their house already, and I’ve met his family. He has three younger sisters (the oldest is about 13), and they all seem to like me. His parents have been kind too.

Now that I live there, though, I feel uncomfortable sometimes. I don’t want to get in anyone’s way, and I get nervous just walking around the house. Even though they act normal and don’t seem to mind me being there, I can’t help but overthink everything. I also have social anxiety, so it’s hard for me to relax and connect with them.

Has anyone else gone through something like this? Is it normal to feel this way at first?

TL;DR:
I’m 18F and moved in with my boyfriend (19M) and his family due to issues at home. His family is kind, but I still feel uncomfortable, anxious, and like I’m in the way.

I am engaged but I think I’m still in love with my ex (that passed),"I (24 F) am engaged planning a wedding with an amazing person. So please don't be mean because I already feel so guilty. I will randomly have dreams about my ex that passed away at 23 years old. We dated throughout high school and afterwards, ultimately on and off for like 4ish years. We tried things again about 9 months before his passing. We were young yes but mature for our age as we both had gone through a somewhat rough upbringing. Our relationship was full of passion, ups, downs. The highs were high and the lows were lows. We really never left eachother alone when we would be ""broken up"", always came back to eachother. Though we were extremely toxic. However when we broke up for the final time, I don't think I still ever thought it would be final. I never stopped loving him. The weekend he got into his car accident and died, I called my mom the day before and was telling her how I think something's wrong with me and I may have attachment issues because I'm still not over Chris. 
Today, my fiance is out of town- I had a dream about my ex last night and today I've been in bed relaxing but also crying because I feel like I am still grieving him. 

What do I do? Should I tell my fiance? Am I weird? Is something wrong with me? We were both dating other people at the time of his passing, but it devastated me

TL;DR : I am engaged with an amazing man. I never stopped loving my ex that passed. Is this weird? Do I tell my fiance or is that unnecessary? What are your thoughts ?",0,1l6irfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6irfv/i_am_engaged_but_i_think_im_still_in_love_with_my/

I (18F) don’t want to be with my bf (19M) but he hasn’t done anything wrong and I don’t want to hurt him,"This is my first ever relationship. We started dating in high school and have been together for almost a year and a half. He’s a great guy, very romantic and always trying to do things to make me happy( literally wrote me a song), we’ve never even had a real fight. He’s far better to me than I could possibly deserve. He told me he’s loves me more than he’s ever loved anyone, and while I do still care about him a lot, I don’t feel that way about him anymore. My life has changed (graduated hs) and I’ve grown up a lot in the last year and I’ve realized recently that a relationship is no longer one of my priorities. I want to experience college and adult life as an individual person and not half of a unit. I want to figure out what it means for me to pursue my own future without worrying about what anyone else thinks. I know that sounds selfish, it probably is, but I also want him to figure out what he wants for his own future apart from me. He hasn’t figured out what he wants to do, nothing wrong with that at all, but I don’t want him to be making decisions about that based on me. I can’t give him the attention he needs/deserves, especially since I’m moving away for college in a couple months and will see him far less than I do now which is already infrequent because we are both very busy. I know that long distance will not be good for him emotionally/mentally, he gets very depressed when we can’t see each other for a while. All of our friends think we are perfect for each other and talk about us like we are going to be together forever, we’ve actually been referred to as ‘true love’ before. My family also likes him and I really like his family. I am so scared that everyone is going to hate me if I break up with him because he’s such a great person and I really don’t want to hurt him. I feel like I’m stuck on a train that’s about to go over a cliff. I haven’t told anyone about this, not even my grandma, who I usually tell everything. I don’t know what to do. There is no good ending, either I stay with him and end up making him miserable because my hearts not in it or I break his heart even though he’s done nothing to deserve it. I’m going to try to be a good gf for the next couple months to at least give him a good summer before I move but I’m absolutely terrified of actually having to face what comes after.

Dating My ex’s friends friend,"Hi, I am (M19) soon to be 20, dating (F20). My relationship 2 and a bit years ago went absolutely horrible, ex tried to stalk for a very long time and spread hate around regarding my name around. I went absolutely goals and focus mode in school and got into my first choice university, doing my desired course, got really toned in the gym, mixed martial arts and got my own car. (Because it really did shatter me to the point of bettering myself anyhow and now all I see is just me wanting to achieve)

My ex on the other hand would laugh at her cousin for not going to a ‘credible’ university, back bite about others, only to end up going to the same university as her after messing up her exams. After some time, I am now in a one month relationship with (F20), it has been going absolutely great and we intend to keep it private till 2026. (parents know though and want to see it progressing).

I got to know My GF through an old female friend of mine who I was in contact with since we have been small and she was telling her friend (My girlfriend) that we would go amazing. We haven’t even told her yet that we are dating and  that it’s going well. As a trio we are pretty close.

The issue starts where I found out through my girlfriend that she knows my ex’s friend who I went to school with alongside my ex. My girlfriend does not know that I dated her friend’s friend but all she knows is that it turned bad and that they have been hounding after me since. (I still get no callers, used to get random accounts adding me threatening me)

All my girlfriend says that whatever stands Infront of you we will see to it, fight against it and it will all be okay. We are very private individuals and we don’t want to tell anyone because people love ruining things.

I used to get along with my ex’s friend until me and my ex broke up but her friend still had me added on socials until I blocked her too. What do you think I should do?

All replies are appreciated.

"20M — Am I in love, or just anxiously attached to a 22F friend? How do I stop letting this affect me so much?","I’m genuinely struggling right now and would really appreciate any advice or support from those who’ve been through something similar.

We were never in a relationship — just really close friends. It started online: daily texts, voice notes, emotional support. She usually initiated. Then she moved to my city and we started meeting in person — dinner, long walks, exploring the city.

The first day we met, we planned to cross a specific bridge together and start hobbies like pottery and tennis. We did play tennis regularly for a few weeks. Then I left for a 12-day vacation, and during that time she kept saying, “You’re leaving me,” in a sad, dramatic way. But after I came back, we never played again. She initiated once or twice, and then abandoned the plans. She hasn’t followed up on any of the other things we were once so excited to do together, though we did meet up a couple of times for dinners and stuff. I also got drunk for the first time ever with her, which she was so excited about.

She has shown care. She’s told me I matter to her. She once said she loved me (platonically) and even made me say it back. If I didn’t message for a day or two, she’d say I don’t care. Recently she has told me more than once that she values my presence, and it meant a lot. But after those moments of connection, she pulls away. Even when I respond with warmth, she won’t acknowledge it. She’ll seem really excited to make plans — then go cold. When she’s busy or out with others, I still hear from her, but something about it feels less… open.

I have ADHD and a possibly a pretty anxious attachment style, so this kind of hot-and-cold dynamic really affects me. I spiral with anxiety. I overthink silence. I can’t study. I can’t sleep. She’s the only person I regularly hang out with in this country, so even the idea of pulling back makes me feel like I’m tearing away my only support. But staying like this — unsure, on edge — is exhausting, and it’s killing me.

So here’s what I’m trying to figure out:
	•	Am I in love with her, or just clinging because I’m anxious and alone?
	•	Is there a way to make our friendship feel more emotionally balanced, without pushing her away?
	•	Or… do I just have to let go — and if so, how do you do that when they still mean everything to you?

TL;DR
I (20M, ADHD, anxious attachment) grew very close to a friend (22F). We shared deep moments and future plans. But now she seems distant, inconsistent, and I’m left spiraling. She’s still the only person I see often, so letting go feels impossible — but staying feels worse. How do I know if I’m in love… or just anxiously attached?",0,1l6dsm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l6dsm3/20m_am_i_in_love_or_just_anxiously_attached_to_a/
I(f26) feel the spark dying between my husband(m27) and I,"My husband has been acting cold towards me recently and I don’t know how to get him to show me more affection. We’ve been together for 9 years. I have already communicated to him that at times I feel neglected emotionally because he rarely comes in for a kiss or a hug or any affection at all. He used to be a bit more affectionate when we first started dating but it’s like every year that goes by it keeps getting worse. He struggles to hold eye contact with me and I’ve been feeling disconnected from him recently, even on our wedding day he could barely hold eye contact with me and would just look down to the floor most of the time. A day where I’m supposed to feel extremely connected to him, loved and seen, I felt anxious and a bit insecure. He says he still loves me and that he will try to put an effort to show me more affection but it’s been months and I see no change. What else can I do or say to him to help break that emotional barrier that can help him heal and WANT to show me more affection. I also don’t want to force him, and is why I’ve told him that I’d much rather have him be truthful to me that he can tell me if he doesn’t love me anymore or maybe isn’t attracted to me or whatever the case is. I told him the truth will probably hurt me but that I will handle it and that I don’t want to live a life where there is no intimacy or love. But after all that he says he still loves me. I do believe it and I know he has different ways of showing he loves me like providing for me and respecting me and just being my best friend. We both have separate businesses. He’s a general contractor and I’m a permanent makeup artist so we both have been busier and more tired than usual so perhaps that could be effecting him? We talk about our future and a bunch of other things. We take a vacation about 2-2x a year and go on dates maybe twice a month. He’s my best friend and generally we have a healthy relationship so we still do connect in other ways however just not in the intimate loving way I crave. During sex he can’t hold eye contact with me and he often cuts kissing short. As a women I need more affection in every aspect but I don’t want to push his boundaries either. How can I explain that to him without hurting his feelings or triggering him in any way? I want to add that he has past traumas that I’m not sure he’s healed from yet. Him and his brother were m01ested by their uncle and their mom has never known but he’s opened up to me about it and told me a bunch of things as he cried. I recommend therapy and that he should tell his mom what happened but he said he didn’t want to do that because it won’t change anything and he doesn’t want to cause drama between the family. I feel horrible for him and ever since I’ve known I’ve given him so much grace because despite everything he’s gone through he still shows up every day and I do see he’s trying his best juggling his business, family, social life his health and his relationship with me. Now I’m feeling like maybe I am being too needy? I just want to connect with him and feel seen and loved  and love him back but I don’t want it to feel forced. Sometimes I think I may be too clingy because my way of showing love to him is through all the affection, acts of love, and sometimes he kinda resists my touch and kisses which makes me feel like he doesn’t love me but then I’m reminded of his past trauma. It’s been really affecting me and causing depression for a while. I’ve been really good at hiding it from him as I don’t want to stress him out but I’m so tired of feeling like this and I feel like I might be wasting my life with someone who maybe doesn’t actually love me or will at least never be able to show affection towards me. Any advice of how to bring this up to my husband would be appreciated!

TL;DR: I miss my husband’s affection and feel emotionally distant, but I’m trying to be understanding because of his past trauma.

Am I falling out of the honeymoon phase or is there more to it? (21M)(22M),"Me and my bf have been together since we were both 18, met in college. We’ve been through a lot together. Right before we started dating I got disowned by my family and even now his family is the only family I have. I also have struggled with addiction and mental health issues since I was about 13 but recently I have been doing extremely well and am sober.

We’ve never had a fight and get along extremely well, don’t really have a need to disagree. We also don’t see each other an insane amount bc our schedules are extremely different right now.

But I just haven’t felt as much love for him I guess? Idk how to explain it. Like I still care so much about him and I do want to be around him, but I just don’t feel as excited to be around him.

Idk if it’s because things were so intense w my problems for a few years and now things are normal so my life in general is just kinda boring compared to what I’m used to. Or maybe just straight up getting used to being out of the honeymoon phase or what.

He is done w school in six months and we plan to move across the country for whatever job he gets and I’m super excited. I look forward to moving away and also starting this phase of life w him.

Is this getting out of the honeymoon phase or more to it than that?

I might have ruined the relationship between me and my brother forever.,"I genuinely don’t know what to do here. I told my friends about this situation, and some of them think I’ve essentially put a nail in the coffin of the relationship between me (24F) and my brother (21M).

For context: my brother and I were super close as kids because our parents were always working and fighting. We’ve never had a family vacation where it was just the four of us; there’s always been an extra aunt or family friends or work (they work in high-demand jobs). And when we do spend time together, we almost always end up fighting.

As a result, my brother and I grew distant. My parents were very harsh on me and spoiled him, which led to me resenting him and often taking out my anger on him. He’s also very spoiled and indifferent, to the point that when our parents sent him to boarding school after he got into the wrong crowd at age 13, he only called family once a month.

I totally get it. I’ve been disconnected from our family too, since our parents are... interesting, to say the least. But when I moved away to another city for uni, things got better. I thought our relationship would improve when he came to my city for uni (at a different school), but that didn’t happen.

He’s messy and expects everyone to clean up after him. He’s rude, inconsiderate, and never calls our parents—though they buy him anything he wants, even though he doesn’t do much to deserve it. This made me really frustrated with him.

Being the youngest, he’s coddled by the rest of the family, which means I’m always picking up after him. He doesn’t care to make an effort to change or even acknowledge how obstructive and messy he is. This has led me to have very little patience with him, and I end up shouting at him over the smallest things, which understandably has led him to resent me.

I’ve apologized and am trying to improve, but when I make an effort to hang out with him or show interest in his hobbies, he just takes me for granted. Every little thing I do seems expected, with no real gratitude. For example, I always pay when we hang out since I’ve had a part-time job during uni, while he focuses on his exams. But when I asked him to buy me a coffee, he asked why I expected it for free. I was floored.

Then, when I gave him a spare toothbrush (since he’d forgotten his at his dorm), he didn’t even throw the packaging in the bin, which was literally right next to the sink. The next day, he used a new toilet paper roll and left the old one in the holder, instead of throwing it away like he should have. I got mad and yelled at him, but I realized it was my fault for reacting that way. Still, I told him it wasn’t fair that he expects me to pick up after him. His response was that it was “just five seconds of work” and not a big deal. When I asked why he didn’t do it himself if it was so easy, he claimed he didn’t notice the bin, despite having lived at my aunt’s house for months before.

I felt bad since he had exams, so I made him breakfast and tea, but he didn’t even thank me. I apologized, and all he did was grunt. That was when I realized that he didn’t care about me at all. He didn’t want to visit me when I was sick, didn’t want to get me a coffee even though our parents give him plenty of money for fun, and just didn’t appreciate anything I did for him.

At that point, I decided I was done putting effort into our relationship. I would remain cordial and help when needed, but I’d draw very strict boundaries.

Here’s what I texted him:

""Hey buddy, good luck with your exams. I’m sorry for today, but I’m genuinely disappointed about our relationship. I don’t think I’ve ever heard a genuine ‘thanks’ or felt any real appreciation from you. I’ve been giving and giving, but I’ve never seen you go out of your way to genuinely be there for anyone in the family. From here on out, I’ll be there for emergencies only. If you need anything else, you can ask Mom and Dad. I’m pretty much done. I know they tell us to take care of each other, but there’s been no ‘us’ in our relationship. Good luck. x""

He replied:

""You sure? I still love you like I always have. Again, it is because of you I am who I am today. Sorry I haven’t given you anything, but I don’t have anything to give. I don’t have the motivation to go out of my way for anyone, even friends. That’s one of my negatives, but it’s not a prejudice. I wanted to say sorry today, but I felt awkward, don’t know why. Our relationship isn’t best friend worthy, but that doesn’t change anything. I know you’re having a harder time than me, and I suck at realizing it. Honestly, I almost cried reading your message. I had to reread it to make sure I wasn’t misunderstanding. I want to give you things, but I don’t know how. I’ve been desensitized towards family ever since hostel. But that doesn’t change how I feel. Yes, our interactions are different now, but I’ve thought about it. When we were younger, I always thought things would stay like they were between us, but I didn’t question it. I want to be there for you because I want to, but I don’t know how. Please forgive me.""

Reading his message broke my heart. It reminded me of the sweet, little boy who was once my entire world. But then I thought of all the times I’d called him daily to check up on him, only for him to ignore my calls. Or for his birthday, when I wanted to bake him something nice and get him the gift he wanted, but he left our family dinner early to hang out with friends, and didn’t even thank me when I paid for his food.

I then responded with:

""Thanks for your message, \[brother\]. I totally understand where you’re coming from, and I appreciate your honesty. You have no idea how much it means to me, and I really do appreciate it. I get what you’re saying, especially since family hasn’t been close for us. We rarely spend time together, and when we do, it feels like we’re always fighting or too busy with work. But I had hoped that our relationship would be different, especially since we had to look out for each other from a young age. I don’t need anything material, but I still feel a huge lack of genuine attention from you. I know you don’t fully get it, but I wasn’t born knowing all this either. I’ve tried communicating with you before, but I’ve only received indifference. I appreciate your gratitude, and I’m grateful for you too. There’s nothing to forgive. You’re right—this is the extent of our relationship, and we are who we are. Thanks, \[brother\]. Don’t worry about this. Just focus on eating well and taking care of yourself for your exams. You’ll do well. If you need support or help, I’ll always be here if you reach out.""

Now, I’m done. I can’t keep looking out for everyone else while no one checks in on me.

I told my friend, and she said I should be the bigger person and try to mend things after my exams, since he said he wants to try. But I really don’t have the energy to do that. My parents think it’s my responsibility because I’m the older one and we’re far from them. They say I need to make an effort. When I got a third opinion, they said I was the asshole because he’s just a kid and doesn’t understand the world, so what I did was selfish and damaging to his self-esteem.

tldr: i set a boundary that i thought i needed to with my brother and now his response is wrenching my heart and I don't know what to do.

I’m so conflicted because his message broke my heart, reminding me of the sweet little boy who used to mean the world to me. But I’m just so done. Did I ruin our relationship by trying to set a boundary? I'm so confused.",23,1l68jep,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l68jep/i_might_have_ruined_the_relationship_between_me/
Relationship issues - how can we fix them (25F) - (25M)?,"Hello reddit, I don't post often on reddit, but now I need some outside perspective and some tips on my (25/F)  relationship with my boyfriend (25/M)

We have been together for almost 8 months and both love and care deeply for each other. No one of us wants to break up, but we have been having a lot of fights in the last couple of months.
We are very different people with completely different upbringings. I was brought up in a Mediterranean, extroverted family. I am an only child, which means I got a lot of attention growing up, why I also seek in a partner. I always felt safe and cared for at home. My boyfriend grew up in an emotionaly abusive household with a manipulative narcissist as a father. He never felt safe. He always had to keep his guard up. He is rather introverted, likes the quiet, tries to always be rational, ans is afraid of losing control. I like excitement, enthusiasm and to have fun like a child. 

His upbringing has led to avoidant tendencies. When we fight or when his feelings get too overwhelming he tends to isolate to regulate himself- which is fine. I have no problem giving him this space. The issue comes when we talk it out. I tend to get over things quickly. In the sense that, we talked it out, we are not angry at each other, everything goes back to normal. On the contrary, he broods about any fight or conflict for days on end, to the point where I think everything is fine and he is mentally completely hung up on the fight.

Another point of contention in our relationship is feminism. I have been a feminist since I can remember, while he thinks that feminism is a toxic ideology. We have decided not to talk about the topic and we are both careful not to bring it up.

Because of our fights and the tension that builds up, he feels like he has to ""put up a performance"" in the relationship and be careful about which topics he talks about ( I also had this feeling occasionally), which is the last thing I want. He had enough of this growing up. When we first got together we both felt like we were soulmates. He told me things he hasn't told anyone else, and now he has to take care of what he says to me? That really hurts me.

I suggested a couple of weeks ago, after a talk about the direction of our relationship, that we just focus on the positive aspects of each other and each of us tries to nurture the characteristics that the other person loves. I said we should try to consciously appreciate each other, because we truly believe that the other person is great. We hold no resentment. I visited him in his city last weekend (we live 1,5 hours apart) and I thought we had a great time. I focused only on the positives, he was really affectionate and I thought we had found a way to move forward. However, we talked a couple of days ago and he told me he still doesn't quite see a future for the relationship. To be honest, I was shocked. I thought everything was fine. He told me that focusing on the positives does not erase our fights we've had the last months. However, I asked him if he wants to break up and he said no.

No one wants to break up and we are willing to work on us. I just want to get our relationship to the point where we both feel completely relaxed around each other and he can let his guard completely down once again. How can we feel connected to each other again?

I appreciate any tips!

My (20M) Gf (20F) said she doesn’t have any feelings towards me. Advice please,"Me(20M) and my Gf (20F) have been together for almost 3 years. We have had a mostly great relationship for the most part. We got together in senior year high school and we were the perfect couple. Sex was great, everything was going along great, and we grew deeper in love

Over the past couple months we have had an issue in our sex lives. When we have sex before I would always give her head and i thought she liked it. About 2 years into our relationship she told me she didn’t like head or me really doing any sort of foreplay to her. She only wanted sex and she said she was fine with only sex and no other sort of sexual intimacy (other than kissing basically). She also wouldn’t cum from sex and this really bothered me as i thought she wasn’t enjoying our intimate life and was just going along with it to please me and it bothered me because i wanted to feel like i was pleasing her as well. Eventually we talked about it and it turned out she didn’t like me giving her head and she didn’t like the way she felt pressured to cum. I couldn’t really understand it and I felt incompetent as i thought what guy can’t make his woman finish. I also really enjoyed giving her head. I kept asking to give her head and she would agree and I thought this meant that she still wanted it but inside i think i knew she was just going along with it. I realize this was extremely selfish of me as I wasn’t listening to her and I feel horrible about this.

Eventually our sex lives started to dwindle this. She got on birth control earlier on in the relationship and it affected our sex lives in different ways even when she stopped taking them (not going to go into all the details). We had minor problems and I was thinking it’s all minor stuff and it would all be alright. About 3 months ago i realized that me trying to pressure her to cum and i realized she didn’t enjoy me giving her head so we talked about it and we agreed that I would stop doing that and we went on like that for a while. One day she felt like she wanted it and although I was felt like it was a bad idea to start doing that again I still doubled because i thought if she asked for it then it must mean she really does like it now. So i fell back into doing it even though she never asked for it and except that one time but i thought she loved it as that is the only time she would finish when we were having intimacy. 

Over this past week we tried to have multiple talks about our sex lives and it kept ending in fights which  was weird because we don’t fight often. We get in minor arguments and but rarely ever in big fights and this blew up into a fight. Apparently she didn’t like me giving head and it was super uncomfortable for her and all the other problems in our sex lives  was bothering her. She explained to me that she is okay with only sex and that is the only thing she really enjoys and I believed her and accepted that and for the first time we truly spoke about how she truly feels and why she feels that way and i completely understood and I intended to completely stop doing that and make her as comfortable as possible as I hate the feeling of her being uncomfortable during sex.

After that she was acting very distant towards me for the next few days and eventually it turned out that she doesn’t feel anything towards me at the moment. She says she knows she loves me but she doesn’t feel anything towards sexual attraction or any feelings towards me at the moment and she feels numb.she said  she always felt like she had to perform or act whenever i would try and give her head or just her trying to cum during sex and having these arguments for a few days just shut her feelings towards me off. tried getting her to elaborate but she says she truly doesn’t know what this means or how we get back to how we were or if I can. she says she still loves me but just doesn’t feel it at the moment but I don’t know if she actually does still love me or if it’s just a lost cause at this point.

Could anyone please give me advice as to what she’s maybe feeling or what I could do to fix this situation. I truly love this woman with all my soul and i genuinely don’t think i would be able to move on. She is the best thing that ever happened to me and I am not willing to lose her.I am currently saving up to get an engagement ring as I plan to propose next year sometime. If anyone could give advice as to what i could do to revive the relationship and make her feel things again and get back to being the happy couple we were. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

TLDR: My(20M) Gf(20F) said she doesn’t feel anything towards me at the moment because she wasn’t comfortable with me giving her head over the years and she felt she had to perform and we had a fight that caused her feelings to shut off. Any advice to bring those feelings back or to win her back

Trust Issues and Previous Cheating,"I (30F) just found out now that my boyfriend (37M) had a past physical affair with the mother (39F) of his child whilst being in a relationship (not me).

He is going to visit his child next month for his birthday which means the mother will also be there. They live far so he has to travel and stay there (at their place) for a week. I have trust issues due to cheating traumas from my previous relationship and him staying at their place for days triggered all the unhealed trust and cheating traumas in me.

I found out because i asked if something ever happened to them after they broke up and he said it happened once and while he was in a relationship with someone else. When I asked why and how, all he said “i don’t know, it wasn’t planned and i dont remember the details as to why i did that. I try not to think about what happened because it was wrong. But I know my ex (gf at the time) was also unfaithful.” He assured me he would never do that to me and he knows it was wrong. He said he felt regretful for doing that. He said he has changed since then. He cut off the mother ever since he started his relationship with me and he said he hasn’t thought about her since. He said he knows he is going there to spend time with his child and not the mother. He said he knows what to do if ever the mother makes any advancements on him. He told me his focus, time and attention is all on me because i am his present.

Despite all of this i couldn’t help but feel scared and betrayed (even if it wasn’t me who got cheated on). Something deep within me was triggered by this. I know it would be unfair of me to judge him as my boyfriend now based on his past. It would be unfair to him if it happened years ago but my mind is saying it will happen to you again now. He hasn’t done anything to break off my trust in this relationship and I can see he is committed to me. He hasn’t done anything that screamed “i will cheat on you” when i visit my child.

How can I deal with my trust issues given this information? He has tried his best to console, make me calm, and reassure me and despite, my brain spirals into this endless pit of anxiety, thinking of situations playing out where he could potentially hurt me. I know it is his role to reassure and console but he also expressed having to deal with it can also feel exhausting especially if i negate his reassurances.

I really fully trusted him at the start of our relationship but i don’t know if I am able to trust him as much now that I knew he was unfaithful in the past. How do I go about this issue in trusting? I do love him and I’m scared if i let myself spiral i will lose the love I have for him because my brain chose the fear of uncertainty rather than face the reality.

**TL;DR** boyfriend cheated once in his previous relationship (years before me). How should i deal with my trust issues regarding this?  ",2,1l672bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l672bl/trust_issues_and_previous_cheating/
Is this my avoidance issues?,"Hello everyone, 

I (29F) and my boyfriend (31M) have been together for about a year. 

But as a little back story, we previously dated about 4 years ago briefly. We weren't ready to commit at the time, but stayed friends and on good terms. So there is a bit of history. 

He is also secretly the only one I wanted it to work out with. I love this man. And I know he loves me too. We agree on basically everything important future wise. 

Where my question lies is, how soon is too soon to move in together? 

He has suggested that we do sooner than later. And I am NERVOUS. Which idk why. He is a competent adult. Has a job, car, etc. He cleans up after himself, cooks. He objectively is not someone who is bad to live with. 

That being said, my last serious relationship where we lived together was maybe the worst thing to ever happen to me. And post that relationship i have lived alone for 5 years. 

So dipping back into this is scary. I think because its adding another level of commitment. A level that I WANT, but also am a little afraid of. 



TL;DR 

My bf of a year wants to move in together and I can't tell if my anxiety makes sense. ",1,1l670x1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l670x1/is_this_my_avoidance_issues/
I (26M) told by (23F) that they are not ready for a relationship after taking for 6 weeks.,"I’m trying to better understand my feelings and this situation. 

Background info: Met and talked to this girl for about 6 weeks (which I know is not really long). First date we spoke about expectations and we both agreed on wanting something serious and as she said “dating to marry”. She initiated the second date. Then after 3 weeks of talking she started replying less and would go a day or two with no reply at all. I asked if everything was good and how she felt about us, she replied saying she feels everything is going well and we vibe and wants to continue to know more about me. We make plans to see each other. The day before our date she randomly texts saying she is not ready for a relationship. She was talking to someone before this and hasn’t healed from it. And if we both are single in the future she would love to try again. Now she unarchived a bunch of instagram posts and posts on her story more as if she is trying to seek validation/interest from someone else. I can’t stop thinking about it/her. I feel like I got played. I tried to be so upfront and honest and she validated everything was okay. I know I won’t ever really know the truth.

TL;DR: Should I just move on and unfollow her? ",1,1l65uur,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l65uur/i_26m_told_by_23f_that_they_are_not_ready_for_a/
Boyfriend (22M) spends thousands on unnecessary things. (I’m 21F),"A list of things he is spending money on.

Roblox Wow Wizards 101 Weed Vapes Pokemon Cards

I just can’t. We have a 5 month old daughter. And his mom a couple weeks in a row and a couple times bought diapers for us. While he is spending all this fucking money on shit he doesn’t need. While I am looking at bags online wishing I could make the excuse to spend the $25 on myself. Wanting some skincare that’s $40 but not thinking it’s important enough because we have other needs. Since these purchases he has known I’ve needed new shoes for work. I have had mine for 2 years. I am on my feet all day and these ones have worn out. $200, on a pair of shoes. And he has guilt tripped me over this. Because god forbid I want to be comfortable at work. (Hoka’s highly recommend, they are phenomenal) I only counted Roblox since I opened his bank account and noticed today alone he’s spent $50 on it. Since May 13th he has spent $804.74 on ROBLOX ALONEEEEE. Everything else will equal over $3000 since April 1st.

Y’all. I can’t do it. I have told him his direct deposit needs to be switched to my account where he will have access to checking but only I will have access to savings. He knows he has issues and he “apologizes” and says “he regrets it”. 800 DOLLARS ON ROBLOX IN LESS THAN A MONTH? I HAVE NEEDED NEW SHOES SINCE DECEMBER!!!! I’m about to cry honestly. I can’t do it with him. But he makes more money than I do. I am in between jobs right now because god forbid I get food poisoning and my jackass boss fires me for a “no call no show” because I told him an hour before my shift I couldn’t come in. THATS NOT HOW A NO CALL NO SHOW WORKS. But he gets to spend all this money. When we are behind in bills I get it! But he feels so bad right?

What in the hell am I supposed to do. Actually though. I love him to death. Surprisingly. I would rather off myself than live without him. He’s my world. But he also makes me insane what do I do?

TL;DR: Boyfriend spends thousands on games and weed ($805 alone on roblox in the past month) while necessities and wants I have are ignored/guilt tripped. Such as new shoes for work I’ve been needing for months. He will spent $200 on weed but not to get me shoes to make my life at work a little more comfortable. 

Edit: sleeping downstairs right now cause i can’t even stand to be around him. sent him a ranting message to switch his direct deposit to my account so I am in control of the money where he can only access what he absolutely needs which will be in checking and everything else will be in savings. we have wanted to move out for over a year now. Could’ve done that if his wants weren’t so much more important ",3,1l65t5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l65t5q/boyfriend_22m_spends_thousands_on_unnecessary/
(21F) and my boyfriend (23M),"We’ve been together for 2 years.
I’ve caught him in the past following girls with 18+ content. He said he only did it to “annoy me.” That hurt me deeply, but I tried to move on.

Now again, I see him following and liking photos of random girls. I told him it makes me feel disrespected and uncomfortable. Instead of understanding, he tells me I’m just “spying” on him.

But he knows this is a sensitive topic for me. Why is he still doing it?
Even seeing female coworkers or acquaintances in his following list makes me anxious now. It feels like he keeps pushing my boundaries, knowing how I feel, and then blames me for reacting.

I don’t feel safe or respected emotionally in this behavior.

My bf m26 and I f26 haven’t had sex in 3 months,"We have been together since 2 years and in the beginning for atleast a year we were doing it every week when we saw each other. I’ve moved in with him 3 months back and since then nothing. He has a trucking job so is away most of the week but we’re always on call so I know that he isn’t cheating for sure. But every time he’s home he’s tired which is fine but before we used to do it every time. He lost a lot of money in crypto 2 months back and he told me that’s the reason why he doesn’t feel like doing it because that was all the money he earned through truck then lost all that in crypto. But is that really true? I totally support him and I didn’t ask him again abt this. But it’s just starting to feel off because 3 months is crazy. We just cuddle and sleep that’s all and we kiss sometimes. No makeout no sex. I hate to initiate only for him to say that he doesn’t feel like it.

My (23f) boyfriend (23m) picking arguments after finding out we are pregnant,"This all started 3 days ago. (Im 7 weeks along today we just got a positive test at the beginning of the week.

For more context I'm part-time and Sonic and he is a full time plumbing apprentice, his job is physically harder. Which plays a role. 

We just moved apartments and so we are doing a lot of unpacking. Well I move the tall kitchen trashcan around with me when I'm unpacking to throw away trash easier. I also move it while cooking, like for eggs, so that I don't drip on the floor. 
Well I forgot to put it back before I went to work that day. And it stayed by the stove partially in the walkway. You could still squeak by. Not too big of a problem. (Our front door goes immediately to the kitchen.)

He got home around 8:30-9p that night, long day at work. I worked 5-10p so when I got home I just went to hanging out with him, and I usually get my long hug and a kiss when I get home/before one of us leaves. It's extremely important to me, that's my love language and I've very bluntly explained this to him many times. Well right off the bat, he gives me a quick hug and a peck. And I pouted at him and he replies with ""what do you want?"" And I said ""a kiss"" so he kissed me again. And rushed me to the patio so he could smoke and continue talking. So I was kinda bothered, I felt pushed to the side. 
And so I started asking about his day. And the first thing he brings up is how he wishes I wouldn't move the trashcan that it's very annoying to him to have it in his way when he gets home and he doesn't want to have to move it. 

So I had a oh duh moment. And I understand that it's annoying to have stuff in your way. So I said ""I'm sorry that I forgot it there, I'll make sure i put it back next time"" and he proceeded to get mad that I wouldn't just never move it again, said he felt unloved and disregarded because of instead of saying ""I'll never move the trashcan again"" I said "" I'll make sure to put it back next time"" 
He drug the argument out for 2 almost 3 hours because my repeated ""if I move it I'll put it back"" was not good enough for him. Until I had enough and was like ""this conversation is fucking stupid, if I put the trashcan back WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?"" 
And he would tell me ""well it's that I know you'll leave it out again in the future and I'll be annoyed""


And then tonight when I got home at 11p I walk in. And very first thing. His mud/poo crusted boots were directly in front of the door. (Like he stepped in the door took them off right there and left them) 
And there was mud crumbs on the floor around them. So first thing I did, was set down my drink and mozzarella sticks and move his boots and sweep the muddy crumbs up. And then id noticed he left his leftovers trash in front of the air fryer. (2ft from the trash max) 
Mind you, I still hadn't been greeted yet, when I'm always there within the min he walks in the door unless I'm taking a nap, tending to our toddler or at work. So I walked into the game room, and him an his dad were sitting on the couch. I asked him ""hey can you go throw away your trash please?"" And then he tells me that I could've thrown it away, the trash is right there. And then I told him how id already swept his dirt up and moved his boots from the entrance. And then I greeted his dad, smiled at him god forbid. 
And then he got up to go throw his trash, and as he was doing it, he went ""see how easy that was?"" And I was like ""woww..yeah"" 
And before his dad left, I told him how id gotten him his drink and a mozzarella to share, and then I went to the room to go get out of my work clothes, and put our toddler to bed. 

Well when I came out, his dad was gone he was back in the game room. I went in there and I tried like cuddling into his lap. 
But I was pushed away and he told me he didn't feel like cuddling me because obviously I had some sort of issue. That I clearly didn't love him because I didn't just throw it away, was telling me how I said it with tone. And that he felt bad because I smiled at his dad, and then told me I should go cuddle his dad instead. 
And is telling me that it's just obvious that I want to break up? Because we've had a lot of arguing this week and we were supposed to be starting fresh at our new apartment. Then told me I was trying to gaslight him? How? 
 
And so I left the conversation. He was making me feel crazy. Telling me I came at him with attitude. That I don't love him? 

So I called his dad and asked him, when I came in did I sound rude when I asked him to throw his trash? 
I literally said 
""Hey can you go throw away your trash please?"" 
And his dad said he was overreacting, that I didn't sound rude at all and that he would talk to him. 

But I'm just clueless as to what to do.

"A coworker (M22) now ignores me (F26) because i ‘rejected’ him. Now it affects work, other than reporting to HR, what else could i do?","TD;LR - A coworker (M22) who used to flirt with me now is feeling the rejection and acting cold towards me. It affects work as well because my position has to highly engage with a manager & assistant managers (his position). Other than reporting to HR, what else could i do?

A few months back i started this job and everything was totally fine. This guy was being extra playful with me until i & others finally understood that he was flirting with me. (I wouldn’t go through the details why i & other coworkers thought that, this is not the point of this post.) I didn’t like him back but just saw him as a very helpful & funny coworker. One day he was teasing me by asking me loads of questions while i was working on a task i’d never done before. So, i pissed off and told him to stop. He’s then started acting cold since that day. He told another colleague (F20) that it seemed i didn’t need him anymore. 

Before we had this issue, when i made a mistake, he’d tell me the other day that i did it wrong and laughed it off (he had his playful nature). But last night, he chose to post on a work group chat about my mistake with a formal language like he’d always done with others. (Yeah prior to this incident he gave me a special treatment by jokingly correcting my mistake in person.) After i saw the message, i asked him what the correct way in performing the task was, he did’t respond. I then texted him privately, he still ignored my message while still engaging with others in the group chat. 

I’ll start recording his behaviours to HR for sure yes. But what could i do while still working here? I’ve forgot to tell you that there’s 1 manager who’s busy most of the time and 2 assistant managers, which one of them is him and he’s more competent than another. My position is a Management Trainee so it’s crucial to learn work stuff with 3 of them.

My girlfriend is depressed 25M 23F and I don't know how to help her.,"My girlfriend is depressed and I think the major contributing factor that I can think of is due to arguments with her parents almost everyday. Her mom seems to lash out on her for the stupidest things and she says some very hurtful things like ""I wish I would never have to see your face again"". ""You are as good as dead to me"", ""Everything wrong happening is your fault"". On top of that her parents has no empathy. She returns home and her parents expects her to cook dinner. It's draining her completely. Her work doesn't pay salary on time almost 1 month late and that's not helping her either.

I am thinking of breaking up with my boyfriend because he’s getting crazier,"I just started dating my boyfriend about a week ago and he was chill at the start but he’s getting crazier as days go by. Like I woke up to 30 texts from him this morning.

The worst was yesterday, where he sent me texts almost every few minutes. With every text, comes a phone call, back to back. I also told him I was out with my family but he kept trying to double confirm almost every minute/hour… which was exhausting as hell for me that I felt so turned off. He would doubt me and expect me to send pictures of where I am and who I’m with… but when I requested for the same, he told me he can’t do it and won’t because he “don’t like to take photos” but promised me that he’s sincere.

He told me that’s because he likes me too much that he gets anxious when I don’t reply. I spoke to him on call yst and he told me he will not stop doing that,, and tried to gaslight me by saying stuff like “alright, you think I’m annoying? Then I’ll stop annoying you” and he didn’t want to let me go to bed too. I told him I’m really tired and want to sleep so I want to hang call,, which made him mad and hung my call without saying bye. I called him out multiple times so he kept dialling back (we called on and off for abt 5-6 times) because he kept hanging on me whenever he felt “triggered”.

Not only that, he told me before that he doesn’t want to visit my country and is adamant in that (we’re LDR). And told me he has no thoughts of migrating too.

I think I want to breakup with him, but am unsure if that’s a right call.

TL;DR My boyfriend is getting crazier; sending me tons of texts and always having to confirm what I’m doing and where I am, every few mins/1 hour. Wants me to send photos to “prove myself” but would nvr send me. I want to breakup, not sure what to do.

Edit: thank you everyone for your advice and support, I’ll break it off with him 

Edit 2: we have been friends for some time, just not those kind where we text everyday

Edit 3: He confessed that he thinks he has some mental issues (so ig he’s self aware). Broken off, thanks everyone! I actually really like him but his insecurity stresses me out and I feel like I am quite similar to him in terms of that so it helped me to reflect on my own behaviours too! He also actually asked me how to resist texting so much too which I was shocked. ",130,1l643ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l643ss/i_am_thinking_of_breaking_up_with_my_boyfriend/
"I (18M) want to break up with my girlfriend (18F) because of her emotional dependance on me, but I feel too much guilt","My girlfriend (18F) and I (18M) have been together for around a year. The first few months were great, and after a while I left my abusive household to live with her and her family. (This was planned before we got together, so dating or not it would have happened anyway.) Around the time that I was getting ready to move, her mental health dropped rapidly. She was hesitant to tell me at first just how bad it had gotten but eventually did, and made me swear off telling her family as she felt like they wouldn't understand. I did under the condition that she would tell me when things got bad so I could help her. But things got really bad, really fast. Then they got worse. 

She relied on me and my support heavily, constantly needing reassurance and communication to get through the day and the night. I heavily encouraged her to talk to her teachers and her counselor/therapist, and offered as much advice as I could on how she could go about saying it, but she said she just couldn't. The more she leaned, the less of myself I could carry. I sat her down and told her that being her only support was incredibly difficult as I was struggling with my own mental health, but she said she just couldn't tell anyone else, and even at one point said ""I don't want to get better."" Seeing her this down broke me, and I felt personally responsible for it. The though alone tore me to pieces.  
  
She stopped telling me when things got bad, leading to several times in the relationship where her actions were straight up ignorant to my feelings and blatantly triggering, but, I've been where she was. I wanted to be there for her the same way I wish someone was for me. So I stayed, but I slowly began to lose interest in everything we did together. Her constant depressing attitude and self loathing made it hard to enjoy things. Her admiration of me turned into straight up envy, and she'd begin to put herself down in favor of complimenting me. I hated that, and I began to breathe sighs of relief whenever she was gone. 

She slowly started getting better as time passed, but as her mood improved, mine declined with the weight of keeping her mental health a secret. I slowly stopped attempting to spend time with her out of fear and guilt. Recently, we had a conversation about how she feels like I've been ignoring her, and I finally let her know that I thought it was cruel of her to act like the past year of our relationship didn't happen, even if she was getting better. I once again brought up seeing a therapist or just talking to anyone but me and reiterated that I could not be the only person helping her through this, but the conversation ended up nowhere and we dropped it.   
  
Honestly, I want to break up, or at least take a break, but because I'm her only form of support I feel so guilty. She says my support helped her a lot, and I'm worried by breaking up with her and taking that support away, anything she does to herself will be my fault. I'm also worried that if her parents find out, they'll blame me and criticize me for not telling them sooner.

TL;DR: My girlfriend's mental health tanked hard and it took me down with her. Even though she's getting better, she still won't talk about it with anyone else but me and it's exhausting. I want to break up but I'm her only emotional support AND it'll go against her wishes of not having her family know about it. I am struggling with the guilt of being personally responsible for this. What do I do? Any and all advice is appreciated.",0,1l5zngk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5zngk/i_18m_want_to_break_up_with_my_girlfriend_18f/
My (19F) boyfriend (18M) won't do things with me but he'll do it with his friends,"We've been together for almost 2 years and for the last like 6 months I feel like he's not putting effort into the relationship like he can't even plan a single date.

I won't go into much detail but specifically over the last 2 months I've told him I want us to have a picnic, go swimming, go to a bigger city nearby, go on a night out (my friends dont go out and I love dancing), and go try new lidl bakery items. 

Over the last 2 months with his friends he's had a picnic, gone swimming, gone to the bigger city, gone on nights out every week, and gone on what he calls ""dates"" with his friends to buy things from the bakery and eat them at a park. 

In April we had an argument about how he wasn't putting in effort and he never did things with me and he said he'd change and he did for like 2 weeks and I'm just so tired of whenever we hang out just going to his house and watching TV or only going into the town if I have to buy something. 

Just a few days ago I said I wanted to go to the zoo because they had baby penguins and I asked him to pick a date and we went back and forth with him saying ""no you pick"" and I sent a big paragraph about how tired I am and how I'm not asking for him to plan a whole date just what day we're going. I don't think I'm asking for too much??

I'm just so tired and it's my first real relationship and when we're together he treats me to well I just need advice please.

Should I (32f) apologize to my bfs mom (32m) for hurting him and being untactful in the past?,"So my boyfriend and I recently got together, but we’ve known each other for about 15 years or so. We dated very briefly in high school and I went to his house on occasion. I met his family and his mom a couple times and she had a very bad impression of me. I was the type of teenager that said whatever I wanted, didn’t have much manners or respect, put my foot in my mouth at the family dinner, dressed in all black which she didn’t like, and in the end I ended up hurting her son by dumping him for someone else out of nowhere, which really hurt him understandably. I was kind of a jackass back then and fully acknowledge it. I moved out of state in my mid 20s, we stayed friends until about 7 years ago I went through an abusive relationship and I lost contact with everyone I knew. I got years of therapy and we reconnected and started dating. I’m going to re meet his mom soon and am debating apologizing for the past behavior in front of her and toward her son. Not sure if that’s something a mother would appreciate or if it would just be digging up the past unnecessarily. I know that I want to speak well about him and tell her how much I appreciate him and feel so lucky, but I dont know if an apology is too much I guess?

TLDR; bf and I had a messy past as teens, his mom disapproved. She’s being open minded and respectful of our relationship now that we’re dating as adults, I’m meeting her soon.

The lastest instance was when my partner was at the shops picking up groceries and snacks whilst I was at home. Over the phone, he pointed out that woolies had an apple turnover in stock which i wanted earlier in the week (bcus of period cravings) and then continued the rest of the shopping. 

He came home and to my surprise he didn't get me the apple turnover. His reasoning was: ""that I have been doing so well with avoiding sugar"" and that he was ""saving me"".... his logic doesnt make any sense though because he had also bought me a bottle of wine, which I didn't even ask for. If he was genuinely concerned for my health, wouldn't he also avoid getting the wine? 
I barely get snacks for myself, always for him. When he gets snacks, he always get significantly more for himself than what he gets me (if any) My sweets/snacks last for a week or few, compared to him eating his within the night.
Im considered skinny by most, and I usually eat pretty clean food otherwise.

Another instance is when I am doing things not the effecient way. There are many moments like this, but one of them is about the coffee grinds. We grind our coffee and put it in a jar. When im feeling lazy, I don't put it in the jar straight away (It is tedious to do) and I just scoop the coffee out of the grinder to put it in the percolator first and put the rest of the coffee in the jar later.
He has pulled me up on it a few times, knowing why I do it and that I usually do it the proper way.

He does this with many other things, questioning and trying to correct me when he also does the same things the lazy way!

He always makes comments about how im taking too long, but will also do something that makes whatever we are doing longer e.g: cooking, getting dressed, getting ready for a shower, shopping ect... 
If anything, he usually takes longer because of his time blindness & im usually pretty aware of how long i am taking, unless I am overstimulated.
I also am pretty patient with him when he takes his time due to his ADHD 

He also complains when I do shopping or run errands on my own when he is at work. 
I dont drive, so it takes abit longer but but it only takes 8-15minutes one way when going to the shops & am usually pretty quick inside. He says we can go together on the weekend or when he's finished with work, but sometimes I need to get the groceries/run errands before he is free (I cook breakfast, dinner and usually lunch for us everday, feed the cat & dog I do 95% of the shopping, delivery for big shops &  I keep track of we need/want)

I also have to explain in detail to him why I dont want sex. He can never accept a simply ""no, I don't feel like it. We have sex nearly EVERDAY because of his sex drive. He is completely aware majority of the time I do not want sex & keep up with him to keep him satisified. It's so frustrating, because even on my period I have to explain to him why I dont want to do anything as he just conveniently forgets how I feel when im on my period. 
My period is the only time I look forward to not having sex with a justified reason, yet he still gets upset and expects sex from me 

I have to explain to him why I am doing something a certain way with things, especially when I cook. He then he proceeds to tell me how to do it differently. He rarely helps with cooking, deciding what to eat and never takes the lead in that aspect. So I feel really disrespected when he questions me and tells me what to do (he also knows only how to cook basic stuff).... 

Last night, he also commented about how i didn't help him bring the groceries in. Thing is, I was unaware he came home because the family room door was shut whilst I was chatting with a housemate, and he brought both bags in at once. Funny thing is, he watches me bring in multiple bags of groceries when we have a delivery and never helps me. 

He says I never accept help, never listen to him and am stuck in my ways (there are so many things I compromise on to make our relationship work and make him happy) he also gets upset at me when I dont ask him for help!! Such as cleaning up dishes. Which i don't think I should have to ask because everyone contributes to it and is a communal mess!

Tl;DR, My partner is controlling what I consume, is complaining about my behaviour that he does, questioning why I am doing things to then tell me how to do it differently, also pushing my boundaries. Is this behaviour really from a place of concern and curiosity, or is he nitpicking at me ???

I (27F) feel like my boyfriend (31M) is weighing me down and I can’t believe I’m giving up,"My (27F) and my boyfriend (31M) have been together for five years. It’s the longest and best relationship I’ve been in. He is truly my best friend.

Early into the relationship I honestly was not a great partner. I had sooo much to learn about how to be more emotionally available and he really stuck with me as I grew and became a better partner and person. I read books, took classes, everything you can think of. Initially, I was really triggered by his anxious attachment, but developed more space to love and reassure him.

I thought this was a good thing until I realized my whole identity in our relationship was making sure he felt safe. We went out on a double date with friends and when everyone was hugging at the end, I didn’t hug the boyfriend because I was worried it would make my boyfriend feel triggered. At that point I realized I evaluated all my behaviors through the lens of his safety and reassurance. 

So fast forward a bit, things have been kind of bad for a year. At first I would bring up issues and every time I did he would get defensive and say I ruined the evening by trying to talk, and would tell me things were going well and he was confused. This happened every time. Until I was tip toeing, not sure how to bring anything up without making him defensive. He was defensive a lot, sometimes just in general, like always a tiny bit triggered.

I was so tired of being the protector and he wasn’t sexy to me because he never took the lead and he was never grounded. Honestly I felt like his mom. So fast forward a bit more and he finally listens. He finally says “you’re right, I’m going to try.” So he goes to a psychiatrist for and reads a book that I asked him to read. Overnight, our whole relationship changed. Like it was too good to be true y’all. 

He was patient, calm, grounded, and non-defensive, a good listener. I cried. I literally cried, it was like all my energy that I had been channeling, trying so hard to work with him, could finally be released. I couldn’t believe how much easier talking to him was and how much effort I had been putting in prior. I realized that things could feel SO good and after that I realized I might not be able to settle for anything less because I deserve to have a man who really wants to show up.

It lasted for 6 days. We both got triggered one day over nothing and we both handled it poorly. He blamed me again like he used to for “ruining our night” and it just hurt that he wanted to be the one who was right instead of my partner. Since then we’ve had maybe two really good days, but mostly mediocre days. And I just can’t live my life mediocre.

Lately he’s just been kind of irritable. When he’s stressed or grumpy he’s not great at communicating. I’ve been feeling like he can’t be bothered by me. The other day we went to the store- I stayed in the car and said I didn’t need anything. Right after he went in I realized I did need something. I called and texted but he didn’t see it. After he came out I told him that I needed an item. He sighed like he was so burdened and it was taking everything for him to not break down over me asking him to run in and grab one thing. I forgot my keys inside one day and that was similar, he just looked at me like I was burdening him.

I don’t feel calm in his presence. He’s always tense, tight, and unhappy. I think the 6 days that he was really grounded, it was like I could breath. My nervous system could finally relax. I didn’t know what I was missing, and now I’m heartbroken. My needs are not being met, I have tried so hard, I feel like crying, I don’t know what to do, but I just think I deserve better. Every time we talk now he’s like, “I’m a slow learner, I need more time.” He says that a lot, but part of me thinks he might say that forever to try and delay me leaving. Is it worth sticking it out? Should I keep trying if I’ve lost the morale? I don’t know if I can even muster the effort again.

TL;DR: my (27F) boyfriend (31M) keeps saying he’s going to show up for me, but it’s been a year and I’m about to break.",27,1l5yehr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5yehr/i_27f_feel_like_my_boyfriend_31m_is_weighing_me/
Bf keeps lying and crossing boundaries.,"F(21) and M(23) together for a year. I’m currently pregnant and every time me and my bf have disagreements it’s over him talking to past partners/situationships. The most recent time he tells me that somebody he had sex with before (that we both know and he lied about at first) requested to follow him on instagram out of no where. I told him don’t be dumb and simply disregarded it because I thought he’d do the same turns out he accepted her request although he didn’t follow back. When confronted he lied about it and quickly deleted her off the page. So it’s obvious that he knows I wouldn’t like it I feel like my boundaries keep getting pushed. I’m pregnant and love him but do you think he respects me ? I need some advice I have nobody to talk to.

TL;DR:: Basically every disagreement I have with my boyfriend is about him lying or having communication with his exes/past situationships. He accepted an ex (didn’t follow back) on social media when confronted lied and immediately removed her. Wondering what to do when boundaries keep getting crossed.

Feeling pulled in different directions by my (21f) partner (22m) and family,"Me (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for about 8 months. I recently graduated so l'm home for the summer and we're doing long distance as he's in another state. It's definitely been difficult but we're making it work. I even got a job in his state that's an hour away from him. The issue is my father recently told me that we're going on vacation for a week before I go back to school and my partner is anxious about us being apart again. I thought it wouldn't be an issue because I'm spending a month with him and then going back home + the vacation for two weeks but now he's worried about me being able to talk to him on the boat and everything. I understand but l've only been gone for two months and then I'm living in his state for eight months. How can I best handle this so nobody is upset? How can I ease my partner's anxiety? Also, I somewhat feel he is overreacting, which I may be wrong so any advice and perspectives will help. He says that he supports me spending time with my family but wishes we'd known ahead of time and feels like he'll be miserable the whole time I'm gone, and is nervous we won't be able to talk on the boat unless it's the end of the day and that this causes him stress. Thank you for reading!

"My mom (49F) and I (17M) have a horrible relationship, and now that I'm going off to college, I don't know what to do. Should I try to fix our relationship?","Hello Reddit!

I'm 17 years old (but my birthday is tomorrow!!, so you can practically think of me as 18), and I'm going to be graduating high school in a few days. After that, I'll be going to a 4 year university. I'm wondering, should I try to fix the relationship that I have with my mom, or is it not worth it?

My parents divorced when I was young, but they’re still on good terms. My mom and I moved to a big city when I was 6 so I could go to better schools, and I’ve lived with her ever since, spending school breaks with my dad.

My mom grew up in an Eastern Bloc country with food insecurity, and that shaped how she sees the world—she’s incredibly strict, anxious about status, and quick to anger. My dad’s the opposite—super laid back, stereotypically American.

I should also note that my mom took care of me. She wouldn't hit me, there was always food in the house, she would do parental things (clean, cook for me when I was young, laundry, etc.)

When we first moved, I was extremely attached to my dad and took it out on my mom. We fought constantly. I adapted eventually, but two years later we moved again—this time to a very small house built for a disabled woman: one bedroom, one bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen. I sleep in the bedroom, she sleeps on the couch. We’ve lived here for nearly a decade.

When I was going through my adolescence, I was starting to form my own personality. I don't know how else I can say this, but I'm a smart kid. I ask a lot of questions -- to a not so good extent. I'm not proud to say it, but but some adjectives to call me would be argumentative, a contrarian, or a Devil's advocate. Maybe I just enjoy hearing myself talk, but I ask a LOT of questions, and when I was young, I would always question my mom's actions -- primarily taking a contrarian stance. This... did not help our relationship. She's also quick to anger, so questioning her actions or decisions makes her angry, and when I ask more questions, it's like poking a fire.

I think it's important for you to understand how many questions I ask. When we went to my neurologist for an overnight EEG, I asked a bunch of questions that probably landed outside the scope of their knowledge. What composite inside of the gel acts as a conductor? What is the metal attached to the EEG? Can the EEG interpret the release of dopamine, serotonin? What would that look like? Or when we went to the ophthalmologist: How does this eye machine? What is my vision? What range of wavelengths does the UV radiation sunglasses reflect? In my classes, I ask more questions than the rest of the class combined. I treat my mom the same way, and this doesn't tend to work out well.

As well, she's very strict about things that she considers to be a status symbol, and she blames everyone else for things. Here are some of the things from the last week that triggered fights/screaming:

I walked to the bathroom at night and accidentally woke her up.

I chipped the counter while cooking.

I made taco meat (she hates the smell).

I used the wrong cutting board.

When I say that she's strict, or quick to anger, I mean that she starts to scream whenever I do it. Have you seen those videos of a ""Karen"" screaming at someone about that? That's how she sounds... but louder and angrier. Then, I poke the fire by asking questions, or by providing solutions, and that makes it worse. She also has her favorite collection of insults to use while screaming at me, including the word ""bastard."" From time to time she'll threaten me with a punishment, but it's a bluff. Generally, she calls my dad, and he talks to me, and he tells me to knock it off. Then, I go into my bedroom, and we don't talk for the rest of the night. Also, note that my tonality above makes it sound not that bad. It's bad. Full on screaming at me for 5-10 minutes. Now, each of our week days looks like this: I go to school, I get home, I eat, we fight, I go into my bedroom, I see her again as I go into the shower, or to eat again, and then I go to bed. For the past 6 months, I have tried to minimize our time spent together.

She loves me, as a mother does, but she hates me. She has a boyfriend, and this allows her to have some sort of a personal life. She's ashamed of who I am, and she tries to keep me away from him. I've only met him \~10 times, and each time, she tells me shut up and just sit there. Often, he'll invite both of us to do something (with his kids), and she'll say that I'm busy, because she thinks that I'll ruin their time.

I mention this because yesterday, things got worse. Yesterday was his daughter's birthday. I barely know her, and I've also only met her \~10 times. To celebrate her birthday, my mom's boyfriend invited my mom, his daughter's friends, and her family to dinner. Because I don't know her, I can't figure out why I was invited, other than because I'm my mom's son. Would you like to have someone you don't know at your birthday party? I didn't want to ruin her birthday. So, I told my mom that I didn't want to come, but she really wanted me to do so. If you guys would like me to go into details about the fight, I can do so, but she wasn't willing to compromise on anything, so she threatened to not pay for my education. Will it happen? I still think it's a bluff, but I'm going to paying for summer courses tonight, so we'll see.

Today, because she was going to sleep over at her boyfriend's house, so I've been planning on having friends over for my birthday for the past few weeks. Instead, because she's angry at me about yesterday, she's deciding to come here. Why is that an issue? Because I just want some time with my friends. As I mentioned, the house is tiny, and she'll hear every word. With your friends, you say things that you don't mean, and I'm scared of the punishments that would occur. I'm just scared of setting her off -- even if my friends say the wrong words, she'll yell at me. (This part is why I decided to make the post).

Anyway, now that I'm going into college, should I try to maintain a relationship with her? She's ashamed to have me as her son, and she hates me as a person. She doesn't want to pay for my college, and I don't want to get along with her. It's not like these issues will be easy to fix. We've hated each other for years, and we both have no respect for each other. I recognize that both my mom and I are at fault, so if I choose to try and fix things, what should I do? As well, it should be noted that if I choose to try and fix things, I am going to college in the same town as where my mom lives (it's the best in state), so it's possible.

Edit:  
I'm not sure where to fit this, but she's also quite controlling. The thing she wasn't willing to compromise over was my clothing. It's 90 degrees here, so I wasn't going to wear a suit to the restaurant. I was willing to go in a dress shirt and shorts, but that was a no go. I was willing to go with a less heavy suit, but she picked the heaviest one.  
As well, I've tried to go for a walk late at night. She's not a fan of this, and that generally leads to screaming, and a lot of texting. If I want to do so, I have to run for a block or two, so that she doesn't know where I am, so she can't follow me and yell at me to come home.  
She hates all of my hobbies. Hates my clothing choices (they're not extreme, like gothic clothing. It's shorts and a tee shirt, but she doesn't like that they don't match up). She hates my sleeping schedule. She hates that I don't like the clothes she buys me (when I tell her not to buy me clothes). She hates that I don't eat the food she buys ""for me,"" even though I can't handle it (like, ham is too salty for me, so I don't eat it. But, she bought it for me, and she hates ham, so she gets angry because it's going to waste). I love to take baths, but she doesn't want me to take a bath, so there's lots of yelling. 

TL;DR,

I'm about to go to college, and that means I won't have to see my mother any more. Our relationship is currently in shambles, and I'm not sure if we should fix it. We fight daily, and we have no respect for each other. Is it worth it to fix our relationship?",2,1l5tu2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5tu2s/my_mom_49f_and_i_17m_have_a_horrible_relationship/
I (f30) am getting tired of my bfs(m33) poor emotional regulation.,"We have been together for 3 years, and when he’s upset, I feel like I’m dating a teenager. No ability to pause, self-reflect, or just talk things out without making it about blame or defense. And what kills me is that he’ll later say “I didn’t mean to react that way,” but it keeps happening. He assumes the worst, and I never have foul intentions. 

Some examples:

1.) He was very quiet and seemed upset while I was making dinner. I tried to make some light hearted convo while we were eating but got an ‘off vibe’. He sighs loudly and I ask, “are you good?”. He gets up and says he is going to eat somewhere else where no one is “stressing him out”. I get up to go do my own thing, he gets upset that I “left”. He thought me asking him if he was good was very disrespectful, and that I was mocking him. I have no idea how. It was a check in.

2.) It’s a beautiful Saturday morning. We have dinner plans with friends this evening and I wake up before him, shower etc. While I’m getting ready he asks me how long I’ve been awake. I tell him an hour. He dramatically storms off and says, “WELL LOOKS LIKE ILL GO DO THE DISHES FROM LAST NIGHT.” I do not understand this. I have done the dishes almost every time this week. In fact I tried to do them last night as well, and he stopped me and said “please, let me do them this time. Seriously stop you’ve been cleaning too much”. And now it seems he’s upset that I didn’t do them this morning. Yet he also gets upset when I clean things before he can get to them. 

3.) We made plans to have a date night after I got home from work. He is playing video games and I leave him to it. I wait a couple hours then come up to him and ask “Hey, would you like to do something tonight still?” He claps back by saying “uhm I AM doing something”. He took it offensively and thought I was trying to imply he wasn’t “doing anything important”. But instead of asking, he immediately gets annoyed and fires back. 

This is not something that happened everyday, but a few times a week. He usually stays in this “I’m right” mood until he eats, calms down, realizes he needed a shower, sits and thinks etc. Then he comes to me and apologized and tells me he was 100% in the wrong and shouldn’t have acted that way.

We are able to “repair” and move on from it… however with each infraction I find myself pulling away and feeling like it takes longer for me to get over it. I would like him to not flip or have these offended reactions in the first place. Like he can see his faults after the matter, but damage still gets done— and I still feel like I’m walking on eggshells even when things are fine. I’ve had some friends tell me this is normal, and other people tell me this is no way to live and he will never change. But I don’t really get like this, emotionally I’m quite stable. 

what would you recommend I do? Is this something that couples therapy can help? Or would this be better suited for individual therapy? I don’t really think on my own I can “change him”, but I’m lost with how to feel and think about the situation. I just hate feeling like things are good then BAM he’s upset. 

TLDR: my bf gets mood swings and gets really offended, starts fight or throws shade at me. He can’t emotionally regulate and it’s stressing me tf out. What do I do?",377,1l5thce,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5thce/i_f30_am_getting_tired_of_my_bfsm33_poor/
My girlfriend (F19) and I (M19) moved back home from college and are struggling to adapt to living at home. What can I do to help her?,"My girlfriend and I started dating 9 months ago at the start of our freshman year of college. We both went to the same high school, but never really interacted much on a deeper level. When we were in college, we met and liked each other, so we started dating. We did practically everything together and spent every day with each other. I also had a single dorm room, which meant we also lived and slept together every night. Everything was good, I would take her out, make her feel loved, do errands for her, surprise her, etc. She would surprise me too, help me out with homework and school, make me feel loved, and many more. 

Nearing the end of the semester, it became time to choose next year's dorm. She got a double suite, and I got a double suite because I was unable to secure a single dorm room despite requesting one due to my sleeping and focusing issues as a result of ADHD. This became a little scary for us as we value our privacy and alone time together, but we tried our best to focus on what we had at the moment. We ensured to use up as much of our time together in our room, making more lovely memories. And then we moved out at the end of the semester.

Now, as of 3 weeks ago, we are back home. Despite living in the same town and being almost 5 minutes away from each other, things have gotten difficult for her. My household is stricter than hers. For example, she can go out whenever she wants and has very few rules regarding relationships. On the other hand, I'm a son in an immigrant family, I can only really go out whenever I want as long as it's not super late. She isn't allowed over if no one is home, and she is not allowed in my room AT ALL, so we can only hang out in the TV room on the couch, meaning we can't cuddle or do much physical closeness.

For me, this wasn't too big of an issue, I continued doing what I did in college with her. I surprise her, take her out, we hangout together doing small things like we did in college, etc, the only thing different is we don't have a private place to be and I can't drive her around since I still have my permit (but my license test is in two weeks). A week ago, she told me in person that she doesn't feel loved enough or that I'm not putting in the same effort as I used to. This shocked me because I haven't changed any of my efforts, but I decided to swallow my pride and listen to her. I felt like I was underappreciated, but I wanted to make her feel better.

I started planning more dates, taking her out more, and hanging out with her every day from then on. I even surprised her after her work with treats from a bakery she likes. I also took her on a big date to New York City, where she didn't know the plan, but I took her to places she had been talking about visiting, like the Metropolitan Museum and a restaurant. There are many more dates planned for the future too. For the time being, everything felt great, and I made sure she was good too. But now these past few days, we have been arguing a lot on text. 

She told me she doesn't feel like she's getting what she wants from a relationship. I asked her if she could elaborate, and she said she feels distanced from me because we are home. I told her it's okay to feel that way, and I reassured her that I still love her so much and that other people go through the same at times. She told me that's true, but I shouldn't compare us to others. I said I agree, but we are learning and adapting to home life. I asked her if she could elaborate more, and then this is what she told me:  
I just want to feel like any other girl who gets taken out by her boyfriend, be driven in his car, and be alone privately in his room. She then began giving me examples of her friend's relationships and comparing me to them and her past relationship (who had an even stricter household). 

This hurt me. I feel unappreciated, unwanted, and compared to others, despite her saying ""we shouldn't compare"". I feel like I'm not enough for her, and I told her this, and she said she feels hurt that I feel this way. And because of this, I started getting defensive, and we argued more after I expressed how I feel and how I've been trying more and more and done so much. She ended the argument by saying she's done talking about it right now and that she needs a minute.

After chilling out and not texting, I apologized for being defensive and letting my ego and pride get ahead of myself, and that I am willing to listen openly. I listened to her needs and concerns for an hour and reassured her. But I can only take so much. I kept asking her if she could reassure me about it, and all she would say was ""I'm sorry."" I started suggesting solutions and things we can try to start helping her feel better and meet her needs, but she keeps saying ""I don't know"" to these ideas and plans that could help. I feel like I'm drowning now because everything I do and try is shut down. I asked her if she thinks it is possible that I can provide her these things, and she said ""I have no doubt, it's just a matter of when"" and I asked her ""what if I can't provide some of some of things you want because I live under a someone else's roof with household rules"". She responded, saying, ""What would you do if I couldn't give you what you wanted?"" this sucker punches my stomach.

I told her that privacy is never guaranteed in a household with other people, and that we can't get it in her house either (not really can't, she doesn't want me to hang out in her house where I am allowed in her room), so how can I achieve that? She said all she is asking for is ""at least a little privacy"" and that since we won't be able to have privacy next semester, it is stressing her out.

   
After more than an hour of listening to what her needs are, I started getting defensive again because I felt like my other efforts weren't being seen or accounted for, and that I needed more reassurance to ensure that she still wants me. After expressing how I felt after listening to her and providing her help and reassurance, she said, ""It feels like I can't express my feelings without you bringing up other things,"" and suggested ending it for the night. This happens the second I bring up my concerns about the matters and her wants. She has also been texting me dry since then.

  
I am honestly stuck right now. I love her so much and want to ensure the best for her, but it feels like all my efforts aren't enough. I am giving her my literal all, and it feels like she doesn't see that and everything else I have done. Idk what I can do, should I ask my parents for a less strict policy? But I feel like my parents wouldn't allow that because then every other person in the household who is dating would feel unfairness because they aren't allowed the same things. I do honestly feel the same about the things she wants, and I understand that. It's just, What can I do to help her?

TL;DR: My gf (F19) and I (M19) moved back home from college where we lived together, my household is relatively strict, and it is hard to have privacy. She feels like she isn't getting what she wants out of a relationship, but I am trying, and these things will come through time, and I have kept the same energy in the relationship.

"I (26F) covered a $2,000 loan for my mom(52F), but she keeps sending thousands to a man she’s never met. What would you do?","
TL;DR: My mom’s been in an online relationship for almost two years with a man she’s never met in person. Meanwhile, I secretly paid off a $2,600 medical loan she was supposed to help repay—and despite saying she would, she hasn’t contributed a single dollar. But she’s still sending hundreds to this man overseas. This isn’t new behavior, and I’ve already covered another $1,000 loan from five years ago. I’m financially and emotionally exhausted. I love her, but I feel taken for granted. Am I wrong to feel this way?

⸻

I’ve debated for months whether or not to post this, but I’m emotionally and financially drained and need some perspective. I’m not writing this for sympathy, but I genuinely want some advice and want to know if I’m being too unreasonable or if I should have more patience.

My mom’s been in an online relationship for over almost two years now with a man she met overseas. They’ve never met in person, and about 85% of their communication has been through texting, maybe 15% through phone calls (being generous). Still, she refers to him as her “husband.”

I want to be clear: I don’t have a problem with people finding love online or across borders. One of my parents is from that part of the world, and many of my closest friends are too. But even they have told me to be extremely cautious—some of them have even said, flat out, that many people from their region use others to get ahead, whether it’s for financial gain or citizenship. With that in mind I want my mom to find love and happiness, but I told her she needs to be cautious.

⸻

What finally pushed me to my breaking point happened earlier this year.

In February, a serious medical emergency came up, and a close friend of mine generously loaned us about $2,600 to help cover costs. Thankfully, a large portion of the total was covered through contributions from myself and my siblings, grants and charitable organizations, but the remaining balance still had to be dealt with.

I ended up secretly paying off the entire $2,600 myself.
My mom doesn’t know this. I told her I was only contributing $600 to help ease her stress, and that she would just be responsible for the remaining $2,000. The understanding was that, based on her income, she could pay around $200 to $300/month and send it to me, so I could repay my friend.

That payment plan was flexible—I made that clear to her. Even if she couldn’t make the full amount each month, I told her to just pay something. Anything.
Based on her part-time income and how few bills she actually has, that still would have left her with more than enough accessible funds to live comfortably.

And yet… months have passed and she hasn’t sent a single dollar.
Not $100. Not $20. Not even $10.

But in that same time, she’s sent nearly $500 (that I’m aware of if not more) to the man overseas.

To make matters worse, this isn’t the first time something like this has happened.
Five years ago, another close friend of mine loaned my mom $1,000, and once again, she never paid it back. I eventually ended up repaying that loan myself—partly because my friend really helped me out at the time, and I didn’t want to lose that friendship over a debt my mom left hanging.

So to be clear:
    •    The $1,000 loan five years ago was from one friend.
    •    The $2,000 loan this time is from a completely different friend.
And I’ve now covered both, completely out of pocket—while my mom continues to send money to someone who has never even met her in person.

⸻

What hurts the most is that this isn’t new behavior—it’s a pattern that’s gone on for years.
This man she’s been speaking to now? Their relationship has lasted almost two years. And in that time alone, I estimate she’s probably sent him anywhere between $7,500 to $10,000 CAD.
She herself is not in a strong financial position. From what I know, she’s had an outstanding base debt of around $20,000 going all the way back to 15–20 years ago. She’s never made any real effort to pay it down, and it’s just been accumulating interest ever since. Her credit is poor, and she has no long-term financial plan or any savings.

Even now, she’s working part-time. But all the big bills—mortgage, insurance, car repairs, internet, groceries, even gas—are handled by me and my sibling. Her only regular duties at home are cooking and sometimes cleaning (me and my sibling do  an entire house deep clean on our days off). She cooks maybe twice or three times a week max. Even when we order food or takeout, we pay for hers too. So she has almost zero expenses, and yet she couldn’t find it in her to pay even $25 toward that repayment.

Meanwhile, she has no problem spending hundreds—even thousands—on a man who’s never once made the effort to come visit her in real life.

And it’s not just this man.
This is probably the seventh or eighth relationship in which she’s displayed this kind of behavior. Growing up, my siblings and I had to walk to school in freezing cold winters because there was no money for bus fare. We often went without proper winter clothing or winter shoes. We didn’t have phones. But at the same time, my mom would be spending $3,000 at a time on flights, visas, and sending money to these men and their families—people she barely knew.

She would neglect essentials for us to prioritize these relationships. She would always find money for them. It’s a pain I don’t think ever really goes away.

I’ve encouraged her to go to therapy, gently, without judgment because I believe she has unresolved wounds and self-worth issues that fuel this pattern. But she refuses. She won’t even entertain the idea. To her, therapy is taboo, and any time I bring it up, she shuts down.

⸻

I want to be clear: I love my mom deeply. I know she’s sacrificed. I know being a single parent is unbelievably hard. I don’t want to diminish that.
But that doesn’t excuse what continues to happen. At some point, I have to look at the impact it’s had on me—and the fact that I’m now in my mid to late twenties, still stuck fixing situations that were never my responsibility to begin with.

This post could’ve been twice as long, but I kept it focused on the main events. Still, I know a lot of people might not have gone through this exact situation—but if you have any advice, I’m all ears. I’m open to hearing from people who’ve navigated complicated family dynamics like this.

At this point, I just don’t know what else to do.
Any insight would be appreciated.

1.	If you were in my position, what would you do? Would you confront her, ask to be repaid, or let it go?
2.	How do you balance setting boundaries with parents while trying to maintain the relationship?
3.	Have you ever dealt with something similar in your family? How did you handle it?
4.	How do you protect your own mental and financial health when trying supporting family members who don’t change?
5.	Is change possible when a parent refuses help, and how do you cope if they won’t accept it?

Roommate situation with someone I(19f) used to date (21m)... getting mixed signals and confused about what he wants,"

I (19F) and this guy (21M) have known each other for a while, and at one point we were pretty close, like dating but it wasn’t official. Over time, we stopped talking, partly because of the distance (we were long-distance for a while) and partly because we both got busy with our careers. During that period, I saw that he was using dating apps, but I wasn’t too surprised since we were pretty distant at that point.

Now, we’re both in a foreign country and living in close quarters with our mutual friends. He and I are sharing a room, and it’s kind of like a temporary living situation while we’re here. We started reconnecting as friends, but the more time we spend together, the more I’m noticing that there’s still some emotional closeness. We’ve been talking a lot, having deeper conversations, and spending more time together.

Here’s the thing: he still acts pretty familiar around me, like things haven’t changed much emotionally. But then, in other moments, he talks about his future in ways that make it clear he’s living his life as a single person—going out, dating, talking about future plans that don’t involve me. Yet, at times, he also gives me the sense that I’m still part of his life or future in some way. It’s confusing because I’m not sure if he’s just coping with the fact that things faded between us or if he genuinely still has feelings.

It feels like we’re in this emotional gray area where the old connection is still there, but I don’t know how to move forward from here. I care about him, but I don’t want to keep feeling like I’m reading into things, or worse, holding onto something that’s not there anymore. Its not like i don't want him, for both of us the most serious thing we ever had was pur relationship so i don't want to rush the decision....

How do i navigate when the lines between friendship and something more get blurred, especially when you’re living in close proximity? 

TL;DR:
I (19F) and a guy I used to be close with (21M) are now living together in a foreign country, sharing a room with mutual friends. We’ve started reconnecting, and things are getting emotionally complicated. He talks about his future like he’s single but also gives me the sense that I might still be part of his life long-term. I’m confused about what he wants and how to move forward, especially since we’re living together. How do I navigate these mixed signals without making things more awkward?

My [20M] girlfriend [21F] and I are struggling in our long distance relationship. I’m worried something has changed on her end and don’t know what to do,"My [20M] girlfriend [21F] and I have been together for 8 months. We started dating in October of our junior years of college and things started off great. We are two very different people but it was nice to be exposed to different parts of each other’s lives and grow into them together. However, maintaining our relationship has grown difficult over long distance during summer. We’ve been apart for school breaks before but with this being a three month period without us seeing each other, it was expected to be difficult and a different experience for both of us. I thought we both were on the same page before we left for our respective hometowns, but it feels like something has changed on her end. It feels like our communication has taken a nose dive and our problems don’t get talked about anymore. I’m very proactive when it comes to problems in our relationship, and prefer to handle them right away and talk about the issue, and I’ve realized over time while dating her that some people need time and space before talking about that problem. It’s been an adjustment period for me growing used to letting a problem sit for a bit before talking about it but I’m doing my best to acknowledge and understand that that’s the way she processes issues. However, recently I feel like we’ve taken a step back from that in where she’ll say she needs time and space before talking about a problem, but then once that time is up the problem isn’t talked about. It feels like we’re just kicking the rock further down the road and making it worse by not confronting it while it’s still on both of our minds. I’ve brought this up to her on numerous occasions and I’m told there’s no point in bringing up the past, which is fair most of the time but when it’s a more serious issue it can’t just not be talked about.

I love her so much but it feels like any time I come to her about a problem or something that’s on my mind, it becomes an argument and she makes it seem as if I’m attacking her and who she is. Conversely, if she has an issue with something I’ve done, she picks me apart, tells me I’m the worst boyfriend ever, and goes out of her way to make me feel like the shittiest person ever. I try so hard to make her feel loved, but it feels like long distance is driving a wedge between us and there’s nothing I can do about it. I’ve told her multiple times I’d fly or drive to come see her but she’s told me she doesn’t want me to, but then at the same time acknowledges that a lot of this problem is coming from us being long distance right now. I don’t see how that can be the problem because it feels like I’ve offered the solution by coming up to visit her and alleviating that long distance. I work two jobs, have sent her multiple gifts in the month we haven’t seen each other, but it feels like she can’t understand that I can’t be perfect. Any time we’re on FaceTime and she says something that I can’t hear so I ask her to repeat herself, she hangs up and berates me over text for never paying attention or listening to her. I just feel so neglected, she hasn’t asked me about my job since the first day I started, hasn’t asked me about how my day was in weeks, and it just feels like our relationship has grown one-sided. I don’t know if it’s just that I’m overthinking things, or if this is something I need to reevaluate altogether.

I love her so much and I don’t want to break up with her but it feels like that’s what she wants at this point. I just feel like I have to walk on eggshells sometimes because I can say something and it can automatically be perceived in the worst possible way by her. I know she’s been in bad relationships before me but I feel like up until recently we’ve been really good together. It feels like there’s nothing I can even do about the way this is trending because she won’t let me see her, she won’t communicate about our problems, and she won’t open up to me about how she’s truly feeling.

TL;DR: Is this relationship something I need to reeevaluate? I’ve tried to open up and be honest with her many times about how the way things are right now and how it doesn’t feel sustainable, and I’m met with radio silence. I’d appreciate any advice on what I can do to make things better between us because I’m running out of ideas

I need advice please,"TLDR: If I should end a friendship with my best friend who is effecting my relationships 

Hi everyone me (24m) used to see a girl (22f) it didn’t work out and we decided we work better as best friends. 

I recently have been talking to another girl (22F) for a couple weeks and she has been friends with the girl I used to see for years. While I haven’t been there my best friend has been telling the girl I’m seeing now how I told her I loved her and that we done sexual acts together which we did when I was seeing her this has now caused problems in my current relationship with the girl I’m seeing as she doesn’t trust me that I don’t still like my best friend romantically. 

I’ve asked if I can do anything to prove that I have no romantic feelings for my friend but she’s to upset to talk. 

Me and my friend had recently had a falling out and now I’m not sure if she’s trying to do this out of spite and make me look like a terrible liar I have always said I loved her friend but just as a friend and the girl I’m talking to knows that. 

If she doesn’t want to continue things with me and ends it am I better off leaving my friendship as well with my best friend as I know this will be something she’ll do every time she’s upset with me as it’s like she wants me to hurt I just don’t know what to do or what to say and I’m upset now also I’m just done being made out to be a person I know I’m not and show to the girl I’m currently seeing that there isn’t anything going on between me and my best friend I just feel like if this new relationship fails that I’m better off leaving my friendship too to stop future problems and pain.

Should I (M32) leave my gf (F27) because I’m not sexually attracted but everything else is perfect?,"TLDR: whether I should stay with my girlfriend where everything is perfect except sex

I have been with her for 3.5 years and we live together. We provide amazing support for each other, laugh together, have the same careers providing great support, and have the same values. She is marriage quality with the exception that I am no longer sexually attracted to her. She wants to have sex with me all the time but I almost never feel like reciprocating and have to awkwardly subtly find a way to push back her advances. I have a high libido and in the past have had multiple long term constantly hyper sexual relationships. I’m always masturbating without her realizing. Every couple/few weeks when I can bring myself to have sex I rarely finish. When we first started dating we had a few months of great sex and then my desire just disappeared.

My (27f) fiancé (27m) is perfect… but I’ve fallen out of love with him.,"
TLDR: I feel my fiancé and I are no longer compatible and he is willing to be with me and change himself just so I don’t leave him. He is perfect in every way but I love him like a friend or brother. 

My fiancé and I have been together 5 years. We met right as Covid hit and ended up quarantining together and haven’t been separated since. We’ve never had much in common to be honest - we have entirely different interests and ways of expressing our emotions but I’ve always just talked it up to opposites attracting. We are known as that couple that has never had a fight.

He is a huge people pleaser and does anything to make me happy. He does everything I want and never offers his own opinions. His mom died when he was very young and his father worked too much to ever get him any help. He still struggles with this daily and I feel like he has been emotionally stunted and stuck at the internal age he was when his mother passed. He sulks rather than expressing himself. Typically the sulking revolves around me doing anything independent of him or my attention being given to anyone else (ex my siblings or cats). He will walk away and sulk in the corner to make me feel guilty.

He does everything for me. I never have to worry about dinner laundry dishes etc. He dotes on me hand and foot and people tell me I’m incredibly lucky. But I find myself when talking about how great or what I love about him I only talk about how much he does for me in my day to day life and how kind and considerate he is. There is no emotional connection. We don’t have things we like to do together. We rarely have sex and when we do it’s because I feel bad it’s been so long and he often gets too anxious about it and has ED issues. I’ve found myself time and time again having to give him pep talks during or I just give up completely and say well “try again later”. It’s not that I don’t think he’s handsome - it’s just gotten to the point where I feel like I’m having sex with a friend rather than a romantic partner.

All of this came to a head when I started a new job about 6 months ago. I have a normal schedule and have met some great friends who I like to hangout with. Previously, i had no friends or time to hangout with others outside of the relationship. He is stuck in a dead end job with shitty hours but has become comfortable with it and won’t try to work upwards to improve his situation.

The real kicker is I met someone at my new job. I’m having serious romantic feelings for him and it’s really hi-lighting what is missing in my current relationship. I’m trying to address all of this before I end up either emotionally cheating or marrying my fiancé and regretting it big-time. I’ve addressed all of this with my fiancé and he is devastated. He wants to change everything about himself so that I won’t leave - and I don’t think that’s fair to him at all. He should be with someone that loves the things he loves and matches his energy. I know he loves me and will settle for a loveless marriage on my end for the sake of not being abandoned. Wtf do I do!!!",250,1l5m9e6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5m9e6/my_27f_fiancé_27m_is_perfect_but_ive_fallen_out/
"Me(22F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been dating for 9 months, and recently decided to take a break on our relationship, because of problems with my family. I'm not feeling optimistic on us working out. What can i do about it?","So, we met last summer and we fell in love really fast, it was magical, the most reciprocal and wonderful feeling I had ever had. We had the same goals, so everything started moving pretty fast, we both dived in and started building a life together. We didn't have the possibility yet to have a house of our own, but I started spending increasingly more time in his house (he lives with his mom and her husband). His family is great and he's living with them because he moved from the city (where he lived alone) to the village where I live and where we met. So he's not the type that can't live alone or anything, he had just moved here a few months before we met. We started also working together on our small business, and staying in his house with him was just more comfortable and more convenient, so I started to reduce a lot the frequency I went to my house (I was living with my sister, 20min away by car). We were also planning to get our own house soon etc.

Because all of this happened quite fast, my sister and my mom started raising issues. I had a close relationship to both, especially my sister who was like my bestfriend. But they were used to a version of me that was always available for everybody and when i started dating and almost living with him, of course I got more unavailable and had to start to put some limits. For example, my mom lives a few hours away, and every time she came visit at my sister's she would almost require that i spend those days and nights there. Me and my boyfriend didnt want that so I started putting some limits and saying more ""no's"". So basically they started blaming my boyfriend for this, and started picking with his personality. He has a strong faith and beliefs and he his also very firm on what he feels is right in a marriage. Meaning we had some matching principles about things like not going out to drink at clubs, not having friends that the other doens't like/trust, etc. Anyway, some of those things we weren't 100% agreeing on at first but we figured it out. My sister knew about some of them and she didnt agree, so she started picking a lot on this, aswell as things he did because of his faith, like not eating pork meat, etc.

They actually started inventing that he was a lot of things that he absolutely is not. Somehow in their head, they concluded that he was a bad, controlling person who was convincing me and trying to push me away from them. All of this was very very very wrong, which had me and my boyfriend really frustrated. He is amazing, one of the purest hearts I have ever met. I know I wont ever find anyone better. He tried really hard to get along with them and in the beggining was even super excited to do it and to ""join"" our families, in a way. So when this started happening it really affected him. I always defended him and us, and got in fights with my family regarding this. It also started affecting a lot our relationship because of us being hurt and not able to enjoy things the same. We also had some fights about it because he sometimes wanted me to put stricter limits than I was able to, because I was also scared of damaging my relationship with my family too much. 

Nearly two months ago, my mom was really unfair to me on the phone because of something ridiculous and started saying a bunch of things about me, us and our relationship, about how it was embarassing for her that we were moving so fast, and how I was a bad daughter for putting those very much needed limits. Mind you this limits were pretty simple things like not spending the night with her when she came visit. And she is very inconsistent - on one day she tells me that its completely fine and she understands, and the next day shes insulting me about it. This led to my sister also talking to me, not so badly, but about some wrong ideas she had about my boyfrined. Seeing all of this and how affected I was, he thought it was a good idea to go talk to her and clear things up about him. 

So we talked: me, my mom who came visit, and him and his mom. He asked her to be there aswell because she is well-informed about the situation, and could help explain things (they're from another country so sometimes there is a cultural barrier). My sister owns a store, so we went there to talk to her and my mom. It wasnt supposed to be a big talk or anything, something simple like ""stop assuming I'm this because I am not, etc"". It was stupid of me to think it would be so calm. It rapidly escalated to a really big fight between both sides. My boyfriend didn't say anythign wrong but started asking a lot of questions as to why and how she made those conclusions about him, which she took as an attack and started being defensive. I was one of the main responsibles for everything to escalate because I was really really hurt about her actions, and had a lot of things left unsaid. I'm usually the calm person but the pain talked louder and I said everything I had been guarding. It ended up with her very rudly kicking everybody out of the store. Because my mom was visiting, I spent that evening with them, and things seemed to calm down a bit. But when I went back to my boyfriend's house that night, they told me how they thought what she did was unacceptable and they would never see her the same way. He explained to me how that was the last straw for him, and how, since then on, he would make no more efforts at all for her to like him or make things right. Because he had tried and these were the results. Two days later I went to my sister's house, because I had promised my mom I was going to be with her that day, before she left. So it was the three of us. My sister said something provocative about what happened at the store, which then led to another fight. With her saying we encurralted her in her own work place, and going on about those wrong assumptions she has of him. I responded, it was a big fight, and I left the house. 

A week later there was my mother's birthday, and for the first time in a lot of years, all of her 3 kids had the possibility of being present, since it was both my sister and brother's day off, and my work is flexible. My boyfriend woudn't be able to go because he was working and it was in my mom's city, 2:30H away. My boyfriend thought I shoudnt go and offered to go with me the day before. But I felt like it wasnt right. She was so excited that for the first time in a longtime we could all be present, and I felt like it wasn't fair to take that away from her. Even tho, I know she was the one who wronged us and I was really hurt. I decided to go, because i felt in my heart that it was the right thing. If I hadn't gone things would've got more heated.

But this affected my relationship a lot. My boyfriend was really hurt that I decided to go even though he asked me not to. It made him feel like he wasn't my priority, and that I'm always ""hostage"" to my family. And he doesnt want a future where his wife will do things like that. I really get his point, I know that limits are desperatly needed, and I've been doing all I can to do that; but getting to the point of actually missing an important birthday, I felt like it was too harsh, and like it was going against what I actually wanted to do. This difference in opinion led to a lot of questions about the future in our relationship. He started putting scenarios like ""imagine it's your sister's birthday and I dont feel like going because I don't feel comfortable there. Would you go or stay with me?"". I answer that if it compromises our relationship than I would stay but I don't feel like it's fair that I'm put in positions like that. We simply don't agree, even tho we see each other's side, what he asks of me is more than I can give him, or that I feel is right to do so. And I fear that if I tell him that I'll always do as he thinks best, that because of his hurt, he'll end up asking things of me that will end up hurting me. When I tell him this he says that he also doesn't want me to do that and be unhappy. But he also can't be happy with my me doing things the way I'm doing. This is why we decided to take a break, because we're not seeing a good solution for both sides.

He says that for him it would only work right now if I completely turned the tables, and started saying ""no"" to most family things, and go only to things we can go together. Not forever but for some time, until my family understands that it's the two of us, and that he is my priority and I'll respect him above everything. I understand but like i said before, I feel it's too harsh and will lead to chaos in my family. I feel like I won't be okay with acting that way.

I wanted to add that I know our relationship is short, but because we went so fast in the beggining we rapidly started to create that serious commitment with eachother. Close to a married couple, almost became already eachother's family. That's why he feels like I should ""give him more"" in this aspect of the relationship, because in other aspects we are already very serious.

I would like advice on if I should give him what he is asking or not. I feel like if I don't, our relationship  won't come out of this break alive. 

Thank you so much for reading if you came this far, and I would really like to hear your input!

"I 25f have an avoidant attachment style, and it’s messing up my friendship with my best friend25f","I want to start with I am in therapy and actively working on myself. One thing I have learned is I am not wrong for the way I feel and react. It’s just learning how to manage it and be able to deal with other people. 

So my best friend has an anxious attachment style and I don’t know how to handle it anymore. It cause me great anxiety and stress I believe because I am more avoidant. But I’m looking for ways to deal with the situation without offending and hurting her feelings because I know she isn’t wrong for the way she feels. 

I’ll list some examples of conversations we have had so yall have an idea. I’m not the most outgoing social person with a bunch of friends. But since starting a new job, I have made a couple friends and I’m excited. My best friend though, doesn’t like this. I can tell her whole demeanor changes when I mention them or talk about them. And her anxiety has gotten way worse since I told her I might be letting one of my friends move in. She will ask me every time I see her if she’s my best friend, do I like her still, am I gonna abandon her. I am visibly uncomfortable with these questions. Mainly because I have answered them a thousand times already. The part that sucks is she acknowledges that she is being annoying, and then will ask me if she’s annoying, and when I responded honestly, she started crying. I said “I wouldn’t say annoying but yes, it bothers me when you ask the same question multiple times”. 

She also actively finds problems with my friends. I try and get her to hang out with them and one time she actually did. Halfway thru she said she was sick and so we left. Turns out she wasn’t sick, she just didn’t think I was giving her enough attention (I was making sure to involve her but you can bring a horse to water but can’t force it to drink lol) . So she expressed she was upset at me and I was wrong for not involving her enough… again we are 25. 

One time my friend invited both of us to NYC. She ended up not being able to go but before that, she asked me if we could ditch him, and just walk around the city without him and meet up with him later. I found that very wrong. 

There’s a hundred other examples but each time I’m honest and tell her these things make me uncomfortable and I feel a lot of pressure she cry’s. And tells me she thinks about it all the time because she has OCD and it affects her when I point out her faults. So I can’t… I know it’s because she is anxious and I’m her only friend. And it sucks im avoidant lol. But im losing it. Please any advice on how to address this problem would be very helpful. I want to have a healthy friendship with her. 

TL;DR
My 25f, best friend 25f, is extremely attached to me causing me anxiety and stress. I want to have a conversation with her about it but she cry’s whenever I try and says her OCD is so bad when I am honest with her. I want to maintain a friendship with her but in a healthy way. Any advice on how to handle this?",0,1l5khs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5khs5/i_25f_have_an_avoidant_attachment_style_and_its/
Boyfriend (26M) wants to experience independence but doesn’t want to lose me (25F).,"Hi, looking for some opinions / advice from unbiased parties as my friends are just going to tell me to break up with my boyfriend.

BF and I have been together for 3 years after meeting at a mutual friend’s birthday party. He was visiting, I lived there, we hit it off and did long distance for a year before I moved to his city. Luckily I have a flexible job and was able to move in with existing friends in this city. Since then, I’ve loved my life in this new city despite missing my family, have found lots of new hobbies, community, etc.

Our relationship has been really solid for like 1.5 years. At first I was hesitant to commit while long distance chatting, then when I moved here it took a hard transition period to get our cadence down. But since then, things have been fairly smooth sailing, we laugh so much together, support each other, we have been on vacations together, know each others families and friends really well, etc. We have shared hobbies like hiking/ video games / reading / writing and share a LOT of mutual friends, we go out, we cook together.

Lately he’s been a little distant but I’ve chalked it up to us being busy, but then he comes to me and says a few things:

•	⁠Logically, our relationship is perfect and checks all his boxes. I have done nothing wrong, he still loves me, he knows he likely would not be able to find someone else with my independence, my humor, our compatibility.
•	⁠However, he’s been having emotions of wanting to go down a separate “independent” path. He’s not sure why - I think it’s because we’re meant to move in together this fall and so it’s scaring him a bit and he’s being confronted with real commitment / future prospects. When I ask about his personal future goals it’s nothing really strong - just like getting better at hobbies (not like buying a house or traveling X place or finding my life partner etc)
•	⁠However when I ask him what parts of being “independent” he can’t accomplish due to being in a relationship, it’s nothing tangible (like goals), it’s just a feeling of wanting to be selfish and not have to think about anyone else, “live by his own schedule”.
•	⁠Part of it also is that he’s interested in exploring other people / it’s a sexual thing. He’s curious.

This could not have happened at a worse time as we had planned to move in together in 2-3 months and my Dad is having major health issues so I’m emotionally exhausted.

I genuinely think he’s just having a bit of a quarter life crisis and confronting the fact that this IS his adult life, he’s no longer just winging it post-college. He never lived as a single guy post-college on his own, went straight from living with parents to roommates while dating me. That could be part of it?

It’s frustrating because I’ve done nothing wrong, and he agrees he feels like an asshole putting me through this, he’s apologetic, he’s just not sure what to do because of these feelings of wanting to be independent. He’s genuinely torn up about it, during these conversations it’s the first time I’ve ever seen him cry. He’s sending mixed signals like being silly/goofy/loving with me and planning for future events together. He says maybe he brought it up too early because now he’s put me in this position of treating me poorly by basically telling me he’s not sure if he wants to be with me, but he’s not sure what he wants, so it’s kind of forcing my hand on imperfect information. 

It’s changing my perception of him, this has been a conversation over 2-3 weeks. It feels crazy to break up over something so intangible? I’ve always believed that love is something you wake up and choose every single day, and you work at it. I think we could work through this and he just needs to go to therapy / talk it out more to realize he’d be throwing away a genuinely strong, healthy relationship on a whim of wanting a batman fantasy… Up until this point he’s been so intentional, strong and self-aware of his feelings, good communicator. This experience makes him seem immature and impulsive to me. It’s surprising. He doesn’t seem interested in going to therapy. He’s been talking to friends/family about it.

All I want is someone who is going to be certain of me, and have the mentality of no matter what happens, we’re figuring it out together. Who wakes up every day and is all-in on our relationship and making it work, supporting me, being part of the team.

I also feel like I’m compromising my own self worth the longer I sit around and basically wait for him to tell me if he wants to stay together. As I’m starting to resent him more, feel angrier at him for putting me in this position, should I just take the power back and leave him? Is he even the guy that I fell in love with? Or should I honor the 3 years of love and patience we’ve devoted to each other and give him some time to work it out on his own, even knowing he may come back and hurt me? My friends say I deserve more, if it’s not a hell yes then it’s a hell no. Do I throw away what I think could be my life partner because he’s having an identity crisis? Do I stand up for myself and say I don’t want to be with someone who isn’t sure they want to be with me?

Is this a sign that we’re growing apart? Should I stay with him even if he decides he doesn’t need to break up with me to pursue his independent dreams?

So confused!

TLDR; Boyfriend is confused by feelings of wanting “independence”, but also says he’s still in love with me, doesn’t want to lose our relationship. ",53,1l5k6ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5k6ih/boyfriend_26m_wants_to_experience_independence/
My (31F) brother (27M) has not spoken to me since or acknowledged the birth of my 5 month old twins,"
My brother hasn't said a word to me since before I gave birth to twins.

Disclaimer, English is my first language, turns out I'm just kinda bad at it. And apologies for formatting.


My (F31) brother (M27) hasn't said a word to me since I gave birth to my twins who are 5 months old. 
I don't want to assassinate his character, but for some context, he suffered from illness through childhood and as a result hasn't had a normal upbringing. He has never, in my knowledge, taken accountability for much in his life.

I suspect that he is not interested in having a relationship with me. We don't keep in contact apart from running into each other at our parent's house, despite living only 10 minutes away from each other (he lives with our parents) I have tried over the years to reach out and have some sort of relationship with him. Inviting him and his gf at the time over for drinks and boardgames, offering him a respite from living at home with our folks etc. 
The only time we really talk is at family events and it feels to me that he is only participating begrudgingly. 
I think he has pretty severe anxiety and depression. He is prone to outbursts of anger (I have only witnessed a couple of outbursts). He needs to seek help but is self medicating (over medicating) with marijuana and I feel it is amplifying his problems at this point rather than helping.

I have a 2 year old daughter that he isn't interested in, and I don't expect him to be. He is a young man, doesn't seem to be interested in having a family of his own for now. I have to say, though, I've been quite disappointed that even though he will interact and be friendly to her in person, he has not wished her happy birthday or written on a card  for either of her birthdays. 



So the problem I'm having now, is that I have given birth to twins 5 months ago and have not heard a word from him. Kinda relevant, I ended up going by ambulance to a larger hospital the day after the birth due to some complications. Despite not being close, we aren't fighting. There shouldn't be any reason why he should just ignore the birth of my kids. The bar is set very, very low. A text message saying congratulations would have been enough show of support. Just any kind of acknowledgement.




As of a couple of days ago, he has bought and is moving into his first home. 
I only know this through my parents. 
Yesterday, my parents came to drop off a piece of furniture at my place (unrelated to him moving), and when they arrived my mother told me that my brother said he wanted to drop in and ""help"". The furniture didn't require anyone to help. I carried it inside myself.
She spoke on my behalf and told him it's best to stay away for now and that I didn't want to see him. She is right. My brother AND Father suggested my mother was just anxious and making a big deal about it and that I wouldn't have a problem. Luckily she stood up for me and reinforced the point that I wouldn't be comfortable with my brother just ""dropping in"", so he didn't.
I believe the reason he wanted to come to my place was because he is excited about his new house and wanted to share that with me.
I'm finding it very hard to be happy or excited for him as he still hasn't acknowledged the birth of my sons, or met them.

My mother has stage 4 bone cancer and is devastated that her kids aren't talking. It's a time that should be happy and exciting for everyone with the new babies and the new house. 

I won't visit my parents if I know he is there because I dont want him to meet his nephews incidentally, and I don't even know what I'd say or how I'd react.
I am hurt by my brother's behaviour. I've have cried over and over. I've been through intense anger and sadness about this situation. I don't know why I'm so hurt and I don't know what I expected from him really.

I have a few questions I can't seem to answer and I also can't seem to look within myself and know what I'm willing to accept.

Am I right to be heartbroken about this situation given past history of us not being super close? Should I have just expected that he wouldn't acknowledge the birth of my sons? He did at least acknowledge the birth of my daughter and made the effort to come and meet her when she was a few days old.

He seems to think he has done nothing wrong and I don't know how to put into words how hurt I am and why. My dad enables similar behaviours to this by saying ""he is a bloke"", by all means, if anyone can tell me what this means, please enlighten me. A few of my friends have said similar things about how they aren't close with their brothers and that they (all female) have to make the first move when I comes to making contact.

Should I put my heartbreak aside for the sake of my mum and for my inner peace? Or is this just enabling his bad behaviour?


TLDR; my brother hasn't acknowledged the birth of my twins or made the effort to try and meet them or even spoken to me since they were born 5 months ago. We aren't super close but are not fighting. I feel as though my family doesn't want me to ""make a big deal"" about it and just get over it to keep the peace.

Is there a way to express my emotions regarding negativity to friends without making things worse?,"Tl:dr my cousin makes a lot of backhanded insults and sometimes they really hurt but i do t know how to address without it becoming an issue

Im F 35 very close to my F 45 cousin, chat daily and like having her in my life. But she is a very negative person. She often says things that are mean in passing. Small things that sting. I usually ignore which means when i do say something she must feel like it came out of nowhere and it never makes any difference except making things awkward. 

Today is just one example where we were talking and i asked where her son was. And she says “hes here… he cuts hair much better than you” (referring to my sons recent haircut).
I answered “thats not a really nice thing to say” and she ignore me. So i said it again and she ignored that too. 

Really it hurts that she feels she needs to put me down. Maybe alongside that pull her sons confidence up. Im sure (knowing her) they must have had a convo beforehand discussing my cutting skills and probably what i did wrong. 

I realised she never has anything nice to say. Her compliments are always backhanded. Like instead of saying you look nice shell say “ive never seen you wear something like that before” etc


I really feel upset about all this negativity and that i cant stand up for myself without it getting into a fight or me coming off as aggressive. I find myself avoiding relationships because i let mean things slide but it festers inside me

Question: is there a good way to address this negativity with her or just ignore and leave it be? 

Background: ive spent the past few years studying how to cut my sons hair in a way that i like. Its a long haircut that takes me around an hour. I take my time thinking about each step and cut it by hand alongside small touches with shears.
Her son has started learning how to do fades and does a specific style which is really nicely done but not something i would want for my son who is 8.

I M17 think I ruined my friendship with my girl best friend F17 because I started to develop feelings for her again.,"Tldr... In 9th grade I had a crush on my now girl best friend but she didn't reciprocate my feelings back so I moved on, 4 years later my feelings started to come back and now it's ruining our friendship. 



This is my first ever Reddit post so please be kind. 

I used to have a crush on this girl let's call her (Emma), when I was in 9th grade and eventually confessed to her what I felt, it was the first time I confessed to someone so I didn't really knew how to do it, I was fumbling with my words and stuttering, eventually she said that she didn't have the same feelings for me, I was hurt of course but I accepted, but even after all of that my feelings still remain the same, I was hoping that one day maybe she will like me back, but that hope soon vanished after I learned that she liked someone else when we were in 10th grade, eventually after learning this my feelings slowly faded away and we just became boy best friend and girl best friend. I soon then met a another girl that I grow to like let's call her (Angela), I later found out that Angela's older brother was the boy Emma liked, which was weird and gave Emma and me  something to talk about or a inside joke as you will. After a few months has passed I then confessed to Angela and liked Emma she didn't reciprocate my feelings as well which stings, during all of this Emma was my rock I told her all about how I meet Angela to how I got rejected, she was always there and especially the most devastating moment during my time in 10th grade. During the final exams I helped my classmates cheat by giving them a piece of paper but they got caught and I was scared of theconsequences I was about to faced and cried like a b*tch, but through all of that she was always there. Skip to a few months later it was her birthday and I planned a surprise party for her, even edited a tarpaulin and made some for with our class and a gift for her as well. In 11th grade we eventually move schools but we still keep in touch and just communicating through online, I would tell her all about what was going on with my life in my new school, even told her all about my new love interest which I still failed to succeed at, and she told me about her new relationship which didn't work out. But in 12th grade we barely communicate as much anymore because we were busy with our own lives and I was stuck in toxic situation which I eventually got out of. Months have passed and it was her graduation day, and I thought to myself about what if I make her a bouquet for her graduation as a congratulation thing so after making a satin ribbon bouquet I then went to her school and gave it to her, after their graduation ended her family invited me for some lunch at their house, I was hesitant at first because I'm just a shy introvert in general and after giving her flowers it would have been a awkward conversation but I went anyways because I was hungry, during this time me and Emma were just chatting and catching up and what not, after talking for a while my feelings started to rekindle again, I don't know why but their just something about her that I can't find the words for, maybe it's because her absolute kindness just shines my gloomy and shitty life, or maybe it's because I was always exposed to that toxic situation that I had and she's the first person in a while that brought me peace. I don't know what is it really, but something reignited those feelings I had before. I started then to hangout with her more again and even made her dessert and bought her snacks and even McDonald's, I had moneytos spear because I used to have a flower business before, this is how my love language is, just buying gifts or food. But then yesterday she texted me that would make my world turn around. I texted first ""why didn't you accept the dessert I made? "", she then said "" To be honest with you I didn't because I'm tired of my family always saying, he's so in love with you it's so obvious he always buys you and give you food and things, you can never say no because he already gave you so much, you will be trapped "". And then she asked me "" Be honest with me did your feelings for me returned? "", after a few minutes went I was just speechless, I just said nothing, she then texted "" Sorry for asking you that, I didn't mean to pressure you"". And I just said ""this is how I treated my friends, I always treat my friends"" And she then said ""can we just go to the things that usef to be, when you didn't treat me, I think we need to distance our friendship for now"". (This is just a summary of our conversation it's not all of it, if there are any clarifications just ask me about and I'll provide you more information) (I'm a little tire while writing this because I barely got any sleep and English is not my native language so this is a little bit of a rough translation). So Reddit I'm here now asking you for your guidance and advice, do I need to tell her that I have feelings for her or no?, part of me wants to tell her and part of me doesn't, I like if I tell her it would ruined our friendship but I feel like she deserves to know the truth. I feel so shitty right now because I know it's my fault for letting my emotions get a hold of me and ruined our friendship because of this. Whats is my next step Reddit? Any advice would gladly help me a lot, my mind right now is all over the place. ",0,1l5i6ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5i6ef/i_m17_think_i_ruined_my_friendship_with_my_girl/

What do I do?,"26F  and 27M - 8 Year Relationship, 2 young children

We moved in together over 2 years ago, had a job then I(24F) fell pregnant with our second child. Everything went smoothly. When our child was born, he (25M)loved the time off for paternity leave and decided to stay off on the sick for months. When he return he lost his job.

I supported him as much as I could, emotionally, physically, financially. Working, paying bills, running a home and the children. During the free time he had, he would smoke weed and drink wine to destress and sleep all day, stay up all night on games with his online friends. as he struggled with his ego and failing to provide. More time spent in the house struggled with anxiety and spiralled.

Now 2years on (27M) drinking litres of vodka on a 3 day weekend, hiding more bottles. I gave him a choice to get help for the sake of our relationship and children. I had to give up my jobs as I couldn’t handle it all myself.  

TL;DR- It’s been 4 days and not done it. His family funding the alcohol, I have attempted to leave him multiple times but never goes, tells me what I want to hear or threaten suicide. He always goes back to the bad habits like sleep all day while I handle everything. But now I can’t take it.

He thinks that I want him to update me about each and everything but its not like that, I just think that If two people want to be with each other and grow together then they will have to share everything with each other including all those small stuff..... So whenever I ask him about something or ask him to share  or whenever I complain to him for not sharing anything with me he shuts me down saying “It’s just part of my nature. You have to accept it.” I find this really frustrating and honestly hurtful. I’ve tried to explain how his words affect me, but he doesn’t seem open to listening or changing. Instead, he acts like I’m the one being unreasonable for not accepting this “part of his personality.”

My boyfriend (21M) hung out with his ex in the beginning of our relationship and did not tell me until I (21F) found out a year and a half later.,"I found out my boyfriend hung out with his ex after a year and a half into our relationship, which was heartbreaking. For some context on the situation, I looked through his phone after I found some information out from a friend (I don’t just randomly look through his phone) and I saw that in the beginning of our relationship he went to meet her 3 separate times and continued to text her for 8 months into our relationship. There have been other fights about her throughout our relationship but its too much to put on here (if you guys want the whole story I posted it in another community which you can find on my profile) Ultimately, I feel like a second choice and heartbroken that someone I thought would never hurt me like this did. I don’t know how to get over this feeling of betrayal or if I even can. So far I only have been told that I should leave him but right now I don’t think I can so if there is any advice on how to get over this I would greatly appreciate it.

Sidenote: I will say he treats me well in every other aspect and he told me they only talked so he could get closure but three separate times? Also, after I found out he has been apologizing and trying to reassure me that he does love me, nothing happened between them, and that he would not want anyone else but the feelings that I feel which are stated above are still there. I know that what he did is messed up and logically, yes, I should leave but I just want to find some real advice on if this is something we can get over because I still (probably foolishly) love him and want to believe that he means what he says and is telling the truth about the whole situation.

TL;DR: My boyfriend of almost 2 years hung out with his ex 3 times in the beginning of our relationship. He said he only did so to get closure when she abruptly ended their relationship.

Everything is a mess. My (22m) partner (22f) is getting pressurised by her family for an arranged marriage.,"*(Tl;dr - She wants to work for a few years before marriage, but her family’s pressuring her now and treating her poorly. We've been together 4 years, but I’m not ready financially and might take 4–5 years. I love her deeply but don’t want to hold her back. I’m torn and need clarity on what to do.)*

She is in the final year of her masters degree and aspires to do a job for the next 2-3 years to become financially independent, buy a house for her parents, before entering into a marriage.

She is at her hometown for an internship right now. And her parents have started pressurising her by saying this is the right age to get married. They are even taunting her for gaining some weight, they are commenting on her physical features saying that how would a boy like her. Yesterday, her mother told her to take small bites when eating as it “suits a girl.” To be very honest, I would never say this in front of her, but i fucking hate her family members for being so harsh on such a sweet girl, who always thinks of them.

They even met a family. Just because the boy’s grandfather happens to be insanely rich. But the boy, he has no appearance, no personality, nothing.

Coming to us. We’ve been together since the past 4 years. We’ve stood like pillars for each other. But the problem is that I won’t take the next step until I have a stable career so that i can always take care of her. I would never marry someone on the basis of my grandfather or father’s financial status. I will need atleast 4-5 years to become something. But I am pretty sure that her family will marry her off in the next 2-3 years.

I have repeatedly told her, that let’s stop talking. I will focus on my career you focus on your life. If I manage to do something then well and good, I will come running towards you. But if I fail, then you please move on with your life.

I feel very wrong when I am talking with her. It feels as if I am keeping her in a sort of bubble. She won’t like anybody else, even if that person is good, just because she would want me over there. She has a family and young sister to take care of, she has a lot of problems to fight, I don’t wish to become another burden on her. I also want to be there in all her fights, but I don’t think our circumstances would allow me to.

I don’t know what to do. I am shit scared. I am very confused. Every inch of my soul loves her. I will break apart seeing her with somebody else. She is everything I have. But I want her to be happy. That matters the most to me. Even if it requires me to walk away from her life.

I (29f) started an argument with my boyfriend (40m) and I think I’m pushing him away.,"My boyfriend (40m) and I (29f) have been together for 3.5 years and have lived together for nearly 3 of those years. We get along great, and he really is my best friend. Unfortunately, things have kind of seemed to stall romantically. Lately, we’ve become more like roommates. Our sex life has dwindled and we don’t hang out like we used to. We do spend a lot of time together, which I know contributes to this lack of spark. When we hangout, we typically sit on the couch and watch tv, lay in bed on our phones, go for walks where we do talk to each other, or go out to eat and sit mostly in silence. Going on walks is really the only time that we’re both actively engaged with each other in a long conversation. I am not really into screen time, and would much rather be fully present in whatever situation I’m in, he does love to go on his phone and will pull it out any opportunity he gets. I’ve brought it up before that this occasionally bothers me, because I feel like I have to compete with his phone for his attention.

I am on my period right now, and am often short with people on the few days leading up to my period. I will get upset and take a few minutes to myself to calm down. Today while I was at work I texted him multiple times throughout the morning (which I often do) and told him that I love him and I think he’s great (this will be relevant later). When I got home we hung out in bed for a bit, both on our phones. We started talking about what we were gonna have for dinner that night and once we decided, he got up and started to get dressed. He then let me know he was gonna go hang out at a bar across the street and said “I think I already know the answer, but do you want to come?”. I’m not drinking at the moment, so I haven’t been going out much, but since it’s the weekend I decided to join. Once we arrived he quickly found a group of other bar regulars that he’s friends with and we sat with them. He was extremely chatty and engaged with them the entire time. We stayed for a while and it was fun. Once we left, we got in my car and I started to drive us to dinner. I was trying to make silly conversation, but I wasn’t really getting any responses. I asked if he was okay and he said yes, I told him he was being a little quiet and he said he didn’t mean to be but to not worry about it, nothing was wrong. 

At dinner we sat mostly in silence, and drove home mostly in silence. I stopped at the store, because I wanted to pick up a dessert, he waited in the car. When we got home I said to him. “I’m a little sad because I feel that I don’t always get the same level of engagement that other people do” I emphasized that I love him and that I do feel so loved by him but I just wish he could talk to me like he talks to everyone else. He got upset and said that the reason he hasn’t been engaged in conversations with me is because I’ve been really horrible to him the past week because of my period. I reminded him that both last night and earlier today I was all over him and kept telling him how much I love him. He agreed I was very sweet last night and in the morning, and that I often am very sweet. But also argued that the other half of the time I am a shitty person. He wouldn’t tell me what I did that upset him this week, but said that he already knows to be extra gentle on my period. That he has been extra nice to me all week and that is why I was being nice to him. I told him that it was unfair for him to be mean and call me names. I also told him that I didn’t want to start an argument and that I thought we could just talk about a solution. He kept telling me it was my fault because of my hormones, and eventually he told me he didn’t want to listen to me speak anymore. 

Based on prior arguments, I know we’re not gonna come to an agreement, and I will have to drop this and apologize for starting the argument. But the thing is that I wish we could agree to set up a date night with no screens. I brought it up tonight, but he said we already spend all our time together. I’m worried that if I don’t drop this and keep asking for more, it will be too much and I will fully push him away. How do I ask for more one on one time without pushing him too hard? 

Also, for anyone that might think he’s not into me. He does always make me feel cared for. And I know that if I ever need help, he will be there for me. I am 100% sure that he loves me. 

TL;DR 
I started a fight with my boyfriend about him being more engaged with other people than with me. He says we already spend all our time together. I want more romantic one on one time. How do I ask for this without pushing him away? ",0,1l5e7aq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5e7aq/i_29f_started_an_argument_with_my_boyfriend_40m/
I feel bad for alienating my Dad who cheated on my mom,"I'm about to air out a lot of dirty laundry so, apologies.

I (22F) found out that my dad had been cheating on my mom the during my senior year of high school. It started summer 2020 when he had to travel to out of the country for business where he then began dating his secretary (typical). When I found this out it was Feb 2021 and he had only come back from his trip for a few days for Thanksgiving, and a few days for Christmas. He had missed the beginning (and entirety) of my senior year, my 18th birthday, and every college acceptance announcement.

To say that I was already hurt by his abandonment is putting it lightly, but my mom telling me this news about the affair and divorce rocked my world. Lots of things were happening at this point with my mental health, and this definitely made it worse. He had never come to me himself with an explanation, and let my mom be the bearer of bad news. I had seen him for a few days in April, then again for my graduation at the end of May, where he bought plane tickets to go back to the country he was staying for business at my graduation dinner (and left the morning after my grad). Over the course of 9 months, I had seen him for a total of maybe 3 weeks.

In June he took me to New York as a graduation present. At this point we had still never spoken about the cheating or divorce, and he acted like everything was fine. During the trip he would call and facetime the secretary (aka the new gf), where I heard him tell her he loved her. This broke me. To not only cheat on my mother and abandon our family, but then to say that in front of me was just disgusting. The time left on the trip I spent sulking and being short with him, and when we landed back home I did not hug him goodbye. To me this felt like the end of our relationship and I would never be able to look at him the same way.

We finally had a conversation (over text because in person was not an option and via call I would have gotten so upset I would not have been able to string together a coherent thought) and he told be how depressed and broken he was, and that he truly felt like we wanted him gone and that we were better off without him. I did not take this as a good excuse because no matter what, I am his daughter and I needed him. I have struggled with mental health my entire life so I am not unfamiliar with the awful things depression and self-hate can make you think, but this damaged me in so many ways there was honestly nothing that was a good enough explanation.

I practically ignored him the rest of the summer until he moved me into college. Things did not necessarily get better, but I could not ignore him forever. He did make an effort to talk to me during the times I was ignoring him, which honestly made me more mad as all I wanted was to be left alone. (But honestly there was no winning for him there because if he did not text me I would have felt abandoned all over again.) He has done things in between that have made me mad at him all over again (forced me to meet the new girlfriend against my will, ruined every college move in + out by not showing up to things/making it about him) and so many other small things I cant even remember.

I recently graduated from college where he has let me down once again by leaving one of the dinners early because he was not feeling well (leaving my mom to pay for my sister and I), not showing up to the commencement ceremony (bc he still was not feeling good), not coming to post commencement breakfast (again making my mom pay), and not coming to my graduation dinner because he lost his wallet. He said he would make it up to me, but honestly he owes me for so much I can't tell what he has and hasn't made up for at this point.

My dad and I still talk a few times a week via text, maybe once a week in a call. Things are okay, not great, but not bad either. He knows I don't want to hear about the girlfriend so he doesn't bring her up. He's interested in my life, actively supportive in my dreams in the creative field, helping me pay off my loans (kind of, and even longer story it's complicated), and lives an hour away so I see him maybe once a month or two. He recently had a health scare with his heart, but it turned out to be nothing. But my anxious brain immediately jumped to the worst outcome and I haven't been able to shake the feeling.

All of these long ramblings are to give context to what I have been going through tonight. I was watching YouTube and listening to a reddit story about a husband cheating on a wife in the midst of a midlife crisis and realizing he threw away everything. That hit close to home. I went back to read the messages from the aforementioned ""discussion"" and I'm so unbelievably sad for my past self, and my dad too. It's now been five years since this has all happened and I feel like I haven't made progress in healing. I'm crying as I write this because I still can't believe this happened. I have seen therapists and spoke to them about these things, but honestly none were helpful. My feelings are complicated because I know he is so insanely sorry and has tried to make it up to me, but he has let me down so many other times.

All this is true and I can't help but want to apologize to him for how I treated him. I know he's not owed anything and that if I choose to forgive him it should be for me and not for him, but I can't imagine the pain he was going through. Not only coming to terms with what you've done, but having your daughters hate you for it and not speak to you. I know my feelings in that moment were valid and I chose to handle it the only way I knew how (running away from it), but now that I am older and with what has happened with his health, I don't want him to hate himself for this anymore. I can't help but feel like the reason I am still angry and not been able to move on is because I won't allow myself to. That he doesn't deserve my forgiveness. And maybe he doesn't, but I can't help but feel like I should give it to him anyways. I know that we will never get our old relationship back, but I'm tired of looking at him like I never knew him at all.

If you've read all this, thank you and I'm sorry haha. If anyone has any insight I'm all ears.

tl;dr I found out my dad cheated and was divorcing my mom five years ago and our relationship's been strained ever since, with repeated letdowns. He’s tried to make amends, but I still feel hurt and stuck. Lately, I’ve been wondering if forgiving him might help me heal, even if he doesn’t fully deserve it.",14,1l5dyib,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5dyib/i_feel_bad_for_alienating_my_dad_who_cheated_on/
How do I (M25) be supportive of my (NB25) friend?,"So I have a friend I've known since middle school and they've been with this guy maybe 5-6 years, married and all that. We've kept in touch off and on through text mostly since they've been living in another state and they plan to move back here. Thing is, they said whenever they can move here and get a two bedroom place, them and their husband would have a kid.

I wanna be supportive, but whenever this friend has reached out to me it's been to vent. One of the times they vented to me, they said their husband isn't respectful of their identity (my friend is nonbinary) and he wants them to have a kid by natural means, even though they are uncomfortable with that. I feel like they are trying to communicate to me they are unhappy. They say they feel if they were to change anything they feel like they'd be abandoning their husband (he has been working on obtaining US citizenship and now has it.). 

For further context, I think moving back here would be a shot in the foot cuz their family is also very conservative/against the gender stuff so it feels like they're taking a step back coming back here/between a rock and a hard place.

I really don't know what to say or do. I know they're quite soft spoken/people pleasing like myself and I don't wanna see them in an unhappy situation if they stick with him/the plan to move back here, but I also don't have a solution if they want to get out of it. I'm not in a place to be able to offer a roof (as it's not my own roof) or financial assistance (as I am broke).

What would you do in my shoes? 

TL:DR- My friend is planning to have a kid with their husband when he doesn't respect their identity/preferred method of having kids and idk how to be supportive when I fear this will just put them in an unhappy situation",9,1l5dejt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5dejt/how_do_i_m25_be_supportive_of_my_nb25_friend/
My girfriend (35F) delayed moving in with me (24M) dor months and im helpless,"So me and my girlfriend know eachother for 2 years now, we met online because of a friend. She already had a partner at that time, but it just clicked between us. We wanted to test out where it goes and she made sure, that she cant promise anything bc she is already in a relationship and I was fine with that.

She lives aproximately 4-5 hours away from here (even longer with a train) so we first kept it as a pure online/longdistance relationship. Over the last year it got more and more serious. We went on vacation together 3 times for each about a week long to test if really would be compatible. It was the best time for both of us. 

So at the end of the last vacation (in August last year) she said that she now knows, that we are meant to be together and she wants to leave her boyfriend and live with me. I was absolutely filled to the brim with joy. She wanted to move to me in September/Oktober. 

In September though she made a mistake and her still-boyfriend found our messages and threatened to commit suicide. She wanted to tell him that she wants to breakup and that there is someone else in her live (me), but couldnt bring herself to do it on that day.
She told me that she still will do that, bit right now needs to wait for a better opportunity when she had talked enough with him.

Because of his suspition she couldnt use the computer anymore and also text less because he would always check if she is texting or doing something with me. So we still talked as much as possible, but less than before. The time went by until the end of Oktober where she suddenly said that she changed her mind and wasnt sure anymore if she wanted to live with me. It was pretty ugly because I was in tears and also mad at the same time and the only answer I got was the question ""is it wrong if somebody changes their mind"". After a lot of talking she finally said that she is just too afraid to leave, because she would leave her whole old life behind that she build, she was worried that he would commit suicide and she didnt know if I would also turn out like her still boyfriend.

I told her that I would give her time until the end of the year to figure out what she wants and to deal with her fear but then I wanted an answer who she chooses... the time came and she Choke me. Told me she wanted to move in in Febuary/March. 

Well now its today and she still isnt here. She told me she broke up with her boyfriend but still lives there. He sabotaged her by taking her car multiple Times on days she wanted to come here or she got sick or some other things.

For my birthday in April she then actually was here but could just leave with the most basic things, like some clothes and that kinda stuff but left behind her other memorabilia. We had the best week together and she was again sure that she wanted to live with me. She drove back ""home"" but promised to come back as soon as possible with all her stuff.

Then every week I asked but she delayed it because of different reasons each time. At this point I really felt helpless, disappointed and angry. Everytime I got more frustrated and told her that I cant endure much more and am about to break up. It really affects me in my everyday life, from work to other normal relationships, everything is just too much and I keep feeling worse and worse. But I couldnt go through with it because I love her so much and really need her in my life. I know she had her anxiety and I tried to help her however I could (sadly I cant drive bc of my eyes), but my understanding didnt help my feelings.

Then she canceled the plans to drive to her sister together and also for me to go to a big event with my longtime best friends that I can only see once or twice a year.
She told me the car was in use because her now ex-boyfriend drove to the hospital because his father had a epileptic seizure the day before she wanted to drive here. 
So... i lashed out and told her to leave me alone, blocked her via discord but lebt WhatsApp open, where we talked about everything.
I somehow found a way to still get to the event with a 10h train journey and we talked the whole weekend about what to do next.

We talked a lot about what mistakes we made, how she was still anxious and how I just feared loosing her.
Then she wanted that I drive to her today with the train and we return together and I instantly got a ticket. But tonight I got a Text that I please shouldnt anymore.

Now i dont know what to do. I thought of breaking up for real because I dont know what to take seriously anymore, but I cant just give up on her. I am here on bed bed writing this after I prepared myself to drive to her in about two hours.
I want to go to her place and help her to leave or to tell me that she breaks up with me.

Tl.dr.: My girlfriend is anxious about starting a new life with me even though we were sure about wanting to be together 8 months ago. Her delaying really drains my mental health and I tried everything I could to help, but also made some mistakes and am now not sure if I should break up or try to hold out longer or do something else entirely.",0,1l5c6lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5c6lx/my_girfriend_35f_delayed_moving_in_with_me_24m/
My boyfriend never compliments me on my personality.,"My bf (25M) and I (23f) have been together for nearly 4 years. We have lived together for most of our relationship together, and we have even moved to a different city together. Lately I’ve been questioning our long term compatibility together. We never really fight, I mean we argue but are always able to talk it out in the end. He’s never been abusive to me and I truly believe he would never cheat. He has a good job and social life. I love him, all of him. His personality, his looks, everything. I’ve always told that he’s got great taste, good skills, he’s smart, and he’s hot (in my eyes). Ofc he’s not perfect but love is love. Howeverrrrr I’ve always felt unsatisfied in the way that he has always treated me. He makes me feel like more of a buddy and less a girlfriend. I could go into more detail but one thing I’m currently realizing is that never in our time together has he ever complimented me on MY personality. He’s never pointed out that he thinks I’m smart or that I have good taste in things like music, tv, and style. I like certain things ofc and have certain interests and I’m always let him know but he has just never even really seemed interested. I don’t think he would’ve been with me for this long if he didn’t like those other aspects of who I am but he just never expresses it to me directly. BUT he has always complimented me on my looks. Calling me “cute”, “hot”, “sexy”. Now while I do enjoy a compliment on my looks I also feel like I would also like to be acknowledged for other things too. Does anyone else have this problem or who can relate? What do you think and how did you handle it?

TL;DR, My boyfriend has always complimented my looks but has never complimented me on other aspects of my character.",0,1l5bszt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5bszt/my_boyfriend_never_compliments_me_on_my/
I need help confronting my mother,"My mother (42) is not able to take care of kids anymore she does not have the support system available to her and it’s actively harming my younger siblings, I don’t live with my mom anymore but still visit. She has gotten to the point where whenever they act out she just puts them in front of a screen, my brother who is 9 now will scream and hit people if they don’t do what he wants them to and my other brother who is 2 dosent even acknowledge people’s existence, just the screens. She also won’t put them into school with my nine year old brother not knowing how to read at all or count past ten. I know I need to confront her but she’s still my mother. She’s never been cruel or even negligent when I was a kid, every time I see her she opens with a smile and a hug, she a very loving and caring mom, but she’s just can’t be that mom to my younger siblings, she was always easy going with me but my dad was the one who put his foot down, my moms husband is rarely around, being a contracter and the kids have no real system or structure to their lives. I love my mom but I can’t keep letting her ruin my younger siblings lives, I would adopt them if I could but I’m young and barely starting my life away from my parents as it is. She just isn’t able to care for them, and im not willing to let her destroy their futures

TLDR, I’m not willing to stand by and let my mother destroy the future of my siblings how should I confront her? I don’t hate her but what she’s doing is wrong.",1,1l5bh99,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5bh99/i_need_help_confronting_my_mother/
I regret sleeping with my bf,"TLDR: I broke my five year celibacy with my bf despite wanting to wait longer and now I feel like he’s losing interest

So I (26f) have been with my bf (31m) for about a year. Although not a virgin, prior to dating him I had been celibate for about 5 years. This period of celibacy started with me trying to address my low self esteem and rapidly declining mental health. It began with abstaining from sex outside of more serious relationships which then lead to me taking a break from dating altogether. In this process I decided I wanted to wait until I was engaged to have sex again.  

I started going out with my bf (prior to him officially being my bf) about six months into me trying dating again. We didn’t sleep together but did do some… things that required we be naked. 

Now, there was no direct pressure from him for sex but he would make comments that would get me thinking. Things like given what we’d already done together would taking it a bit further for sex really make a difference, if soemthing were to happen and I got pregnant we’d be okay, the whole waiting for engagement for sex felt very arbitrary etc. these comments weren’t frequent and whenever I’d shrug my shoulders at them he wouldn’t push. But I got them impression he thought the whole waiting for engagement thing for sex felt very arbitrary. 

It also didn’t really bother me because he seemed very excited about getting engaged, would show me rings, etc. I knew where we were headed and how excited he was for it.

So… I told him I wanted to sleep with him. I’m very attracted to him and this desire was genuine but if I’m being completely honest the decision to sleep with him came largely from what I perceived his views on waiting to be and the fact that i was under the impression he was very excited to get engaged soon-ish.

Call me dumb, call me naive. Whatever. In the months since this, it seems like he’s lost any excitement for getting engaged/married. I know he still wants to because I know he wants a family and a kids and I know he loves me but there’s been no more excited talk about getting engaged or rings or marriage and when I try to talk about timelines he just gets stressed and tells me he feels pressured. I’m frustrated because I feel like I’m only acting on plans he helped lay.

I regret sleeping with him. I don’t think that was the cause of his new lack of excitement but I feel like I did this big thing, broke my celibacy earlier than I intended, because I love him and the result is I feel like he is less excited about me and our future. 

I don’t want to go back because I feel like if I withdraw sex it’ll seem like I’m withholding just so he proposes and I don’t want that. 

But I don’t really know where to go from here. I don’t know how to approach a conversation about it without it coming off like manipulation or an ultimatum. I don’t know if there IS going back or how to move forward. Was I a total idiot? How can I try to express this to my bf?",0,1l5awqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5awqa/i_regret_sleeping_with_my_bf/
I (26F) am constantly feeling unsure about relationship with boyfriend (26M),"
We’ve been together since we were 21. We both had never dated or been in relationships before. He is honestly one of the best people I know and so so kind to me. He does so much for me and is the most supportive boyfriend I could ask for. Everyone I know talks about how kind he is. 

However, I keep getting these doubts that things are wrong and I should break up with him. I even get some curious thoughts of what it would be like to date someone else or date casually for a bit. Just see what else it out there. I often feel like our personalities are very different. I always expected to be with someone more “artsy” as I love music and films and feel things very deeply. Whereas my boyfriend listens to music without really feeling anything from it, same with him watching films. I’ll ask him what he thought of a devastating movie and he’ll say it was sad and then not be affected by it. 

He just seems very practical and “normal” and I sometimes feel like we’re so different. He’s also a very mellow and calm person and sometimes I feel like we don’t laugh enough together. Like we’ll find things funny and we will laugh quietly but it’s never been the kind where your stomach hurts and you have tears in your eyes. 

Am I just worrying over nothing or are these feelings serious? I’ve felt like this for a long time but I also love him so much and I can’t imagine not seeing him again. I’m really scared of ending things and then regretting it for the rest of my life. I also have anxiety issues with overthinking so maybe it’s linked to that? Any advice is greatly appreciated. 

TLDR: Am feeling unsure about long term relationship and I don’t know if my concerns are valid or I am overthinking things. ",7,1l5anna,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l5anna/i_26f_am_constantly_feeling_unsure_about/
My bf (29) and I (25) had an argument and idk what to do. He hasn’t spoken to me for almost a week,"TLDR: My bf (29) and I (25) had an argument and idk what to do. He hasn’t spoken to me for almost a week. Yes the argument is my fault and I accept it but I was having a really shitty week. 😭I just miss my man

Hey guys,
I’m really struggling here to understand the situation. My bf and I have been together for a year and a half. I love him very much and always try to make him happy. So last week I was really struggling with stuff unrelated to the relationship. It was some family stuff and also the fact that we can’t get married till his sister gets married and it was getting me down. I honestly don’t mind about getting married later but the people around me have made it so insufferable that I share my vulnerabilities with him. My cousin literally said to me today “you should get married before you expire soon” and I said “didn’t  your mom get married at 29?” And she said yea but my mom’s pretty. Like dude what idk im just really struggling with stupid comments like this. I try not to let it get to me but it’s stuff like this (this happened today but stuff last week was also said) which caused me to be in a bad mood for a few days. I made the mistake of kinda taking out on my bf. The first argument started with me saying like “oh I don’t like when you’re always asking me to buy you things” because he started to say like “oh you should buy me these shoes so we can match” and “you don’t order me food or make me food” I try to order food for him whenever I can and I get him gifts for special moments and sometimes just because. I just explained how I don’t like how he says this to me and it’s not really him being in his masculine energy. Then I said jokingly you need to get out of ur feminine energy. Again he’s made jokes like this and said I’m being masculine before. So I never really saw it as an argument just me sharing my feelings. He was hurt by this and I apologized. Next day we argued again and it was after he hung out with coworkers. We both kinda have this thing where we don’t have friends of the opposite gender out of respect. I asked him if girls were there he said yes. And I got kinda upset which I realize now it’s totally wrong. He said he didn’t know they were gonna be there and I said ok it’s just that I trust you but not other people. They can cheat on their partners. This also came out of insecurity that none of his coworkers know he’s taken. They all think he’s single. He got upset and hung up. realized I stepped out of line so I said I’m sorry for getting mad. Then I apologized and said I’ve been acting up these days and pushing him away because I have been feeling hopeless because of us waiting for his sister to get married. Then that was the last straw for him. He said for the last 3 days I keep fighting with him and apologizing right after then doing it again. He said it’s unstable. He said I’m comparing him to others which I wasn’t but I guess in the past I said oh so many people are getting married so quickly but I didn’t compare him to others this time. He then said he will talk to me when he’s ready and said goodbye. So now I reply and say I don’t want to say goodbye. And I didn’t mean it like this it’s just been a bad few days.
No reply.
Ok he’s done this before where he’s upset and won’t talk to me.
So next day which is Sunday I let him be and don’t message or call . Monday I message and call no reply and I apologize and am really feeling bad because our relationship means more to me than a fights like this. I also want to add we don’t really fight. Last time he had to take space from me after an argument was 7 months ago. So now Tuesday comes again not much I just tell him I miss him and he’s important to me. He says ok but what I did was a sign of instability . Our almost 500 day Snapchat streak ended and I paid to restore it. I had been snapping him but he wouldn’t snap me. Nor was he opening them. Wednesday comes and I’m still trying to make amends. I tried to send him breakfast but the stupid uber driver couldn’t find him. He got annoyed because he said he’s busy and went down and the uber eats driver already left. Then I sent him dinner later and he snapped me it on Snapchat . He asked why I sent it I said because I love him and want to feed him . He said why. I said I love you. But he said I hurt him and showed instability. So basically he said that again. Then I said I’m so sorry I hurt him and didn’t mean to. I tried to validate his feelings and I said yes I was in the wrong and need to handle my emotions better. I said everyone has bad days and there’s been times where he has said hurtful things he apologizes and I forgive him right away. Again it’s not often we are pretty healthy otherwise. And I know I argued it back to back a few days which made the whole situation worse. I thought we were fine now because we made it out the woods, he snapped me on Snapchat. Now Thursday comes and I keep apologizing bc idk what else I can do. He said I’m going to apologize and just fight again. Now this would make sense if this was a regular thing. But again WE DONT FIGHT OFTEN it was just 3 days in a row which left him a bad taste. Thursday i also asked “do you want to work it out “ he said “not if you’re going to be bipolar and have erratic behaviours and expect me to deal with it. You know I have a lot on my plate and you don’t seem to fully understand that.” I said okay I won’t do it again and I’ll handle my emotions better. I want to be better. I also said you know I’m not like this usually and it was out of character. And I want to work it out because he’s important to me. I also said I need to focus on studying g too. He said “ok so do that then lol” I said okay so “are we good?” And he didn’t reply. And I said “i don’t know what you mean by ‘so do that then lol’ because it doesn’t tell me if we’re good” He left it on read. Ok next day it’s Eid. I send him a cute Eid Mubarak message and then I ask if he’s home or back in Michigan so I can send him food. He replied Eid Mubarak and said don’t send anything. Then I said can you snap me because our streak is ending. No reply . I don’t know it’s Eid and I’m just so sad and I didn’t think it would blow out of proportion that he wouldn’t talk to me properly for so long.

Please help I don’t think I’m attracted to my bf?,"Hi i’ve never posted on reddit before so i’m a little scared please nobody hunt me down and find me or something… The title might be a bit dramatic? I (20F) and my bf (21M) have been together for just over a year and id say for at least half our relationship my sex drive has been on the floor i’m never really in the mood and anytime he wants to do it i will but it’s sort of annoying cause like i said i’m never in the mood, occasionally there’s a day or two every once in a while when i am but 9/10 nah. no thanks.

for context every relationship before him i have been an absolute fiend - usually i have a really high sex drive and have no problem at all with that sort of stuff?

and it’s not that he treats me badly this is the happiest healthiest relationship i’ve ever been in we go on a minimum of one date a month he gets me flowers usually ever 2-3 weeks we rarely argue and when we do it’s always respectful i’ve never felt so effortlessly happy with one person ever in my life it’s completely different to any relationship i’ve even heard about never mind been in! i love my bf more than anything, if the sex drive stays low i’ll happily pretend to want intimacy for the rest of my life if that’s what it takes to keep him but i guess i’m just wondering if anyone could offer advice or reasons for this?

i’ve only told one person - my best friend (20F) she thinks it’s cause it’s the first time my relationships have been good outside of intimacy but idk it’s not like when me and my bf do it it’s not fun? i just don’t rlly feel like i want it ? please tell me there’s a way to fix this?

TL;DR! i’m in the best relationship of my life but suddenly have no sex drive…? hoping there’s a reason/way to fix this?

ADDITIONAL- i find my bf very attractive it’s not that i don’t find him good looking! ",0,1l59tk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l59tk2/please_help_i_dont_think_im_attracted_to_my_bf/
I (22F) fell out of love with my long distance partner (21F).,"We started off great 1 year ago and we really had a spark going. but I'm so exhausted from tiptoeing around her all the time. I don't blame her at all for what she struggles with (not that I have the right to, lmao). And I was (kind of) aware of what I was signing up for when I started dating her. But I honestly feel like I'm getting treated like an emotional bank or a therapist and expected to just suck it up and be the mature person. 

It also unsettles me that we have a weird dynamic going on, in regards to being the more mature person. I have expressed to her that I find it hard to be with her when she acts like a child with the way she speaks. She still does it. Not as often but it's still noticeable. I'm pretty sure she thinks I find her behavior cute but it's difficult for me to. And I hate being seen as the ""man"" in the relationship.

I feel horrible for her because her depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses stop her from being able to live a normal life. But that means that she also can't make that kind of effort for me when I'm struggling with my mental and physical health. Whenever my depression is at it's worst and we talk about it, it somehow turns into a conversation about how this has effected her. She also physically cannot come and meet me so I am expected to fly out to her whenever we can meet. Even though it is nearly impossible for me. 

Recently I've had quite a few severe health problems and my final college exams, so I've been spending time studying or with my family when I could. But her demands have increased and I'm just so tired. I can't enjoy my favorite game anymore without her joining the moment I log on. I know she just wants to spend as much time as she can with me but I can't politely ask for alone time without her having a meltdown in our DMs.

I know I'm an asshole for this but I'm just thinking of how and when would be a good time to break things off, and the damage control afterwards.

**TLDR**; My partner and I's needs in a relationship differ GREATLY and I'm wondering how I can break things off amicably.",2,1l59ll4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l59ll4/i_22f_fell_out_of_love_with_my_long_distance/
I (27M) lie about small stuff to my girlfriend sometimes,"So I have been with my current girlfriend for almost 11 months, very close to a year. We both really love each other and are moving in together in 2 weeks. 

However I often find myself lying or trying to lie about small things (not really that frequent, more like once every few months). For example, I accidentally typed her name wrong and lied to her that it’s because of auto correct instead of admitting it’s simply my fault; I have been trying to quit vaping for half a year but recently really stressed and vaped again, but I would lie about the taste of “fruit” on my lips as gummies instead of telling her the truth. I just lie at that instant without even realizing, almost like a reflex (I am diagnosed with ADHD). Obviously this pisses my gf off and happened 4 times so far, I don’t want to find any excuses such as childhood trauma (I do have a very controlling mother, so I often lie to my mom to get out of trouble, scolding, and even now, I might not having a decent life as a broke PhD student, but I would lie to my mom that I’m fine financially and I don’t need any money since I don’t her to worry about me), but of course the distrust between us is there and I don’t know what I can do to fix it. I currently made a consulting appointment regarding this problem. 

I just want to know if I am such a shitty person to be in a relationship, I’m not saying I want any justification to make myself comfortable, but instead any experience from the community dealing with yourself or a partner that lies about small stuff. Thanks in advance.

TL;DR: I sometimes lie about small things to my gf and this definitely led to distrust between us. Is there anything I can do to fix the relationship and also my impulsive lying behaviour.

Update: it’s not surprising that this is the end. But I blame no one but myself.",1,1l59ld7,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l59ld7/i_27m_lie_about_small_stuff_to_my_girlfriend/
"Me [25M] dating my girlfriend [20F] for 10 months I try to compromise, but she never does","So, I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 10 months now. To be honest, she’s my first serious relationship, so I don’t really know if I’m doing things right or not. I’m just trying my best to be a good boyfriend and learn along the way.

We’ve had some arguments throughout the relationship some were my fault, others were hers. What’s been bothering me is that whenever she brings up something that upsets her, I really try to understand her side and change what I can. But when I bring something up, it feels like she shifts the conversation or avoids taking responsibility.

For example, once she got upset that I followed someone I had a past with. We talked about it, I realized it was a mistake, and I unfollowed that person. Problem solved.

But then, there was a situation where a guy who had previously sent her an unsolicited explicit photo messaged her again. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with her still being in contact with someone who had done that, and I asked if she could block or unfollow him. She refused and said she didn’t want to do that because he might get mad or cause drama.

She’s told me that she’s been hurt in past relationships and that’s why she can’t give me 100% of her trust. I’ve tried to be understanding, but I’ve also been hurt in the past and I still choose to give my all to her.

At this point, I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m trying to meet her halfway, but she’s not doing the same.

Any advice?

  
TL;DR**:** I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 10 months. I try to listen and change when she brings up problems, but when I bring up concerns, she deflects or refuses to compromise. I’m starting to feel like the effort isn’t equal, and I’m not sure what to do.",1,1l591p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l591p8/me_25m_dating_my_girlfriend_20f_for_10_months_i/
How do I know if I'm in love?,"I've [40M] been seeing this woman [45] for 6 months. 

We really enjoy each other's company. We spend most of our time with each other. 

She has a son, I don't have any kids. The kid's father is still in the picture and they have 50/50 custody.

I've spent time with both of them and I do really enjoy spending time with her and her son. Her son doesn't know we're together, and we keep it strictly platonic when I'm hanging out with the both of them. She has many friends male and female so it's not out of the ordinary for a guy to be hanging out with her, from her son's perspective. 

We've talked about telling her son that we are together, and had early conversations about what the expectations would be, but not everything. 

I don't feel ready to take that step yet because I'm not really sure how I feel about it. It feels like a huge step.

I've had one long term relationship many years ago where I felt like I was in love, but it was a long time ago so I don't really remember how that feels. Other than that I've had only 2 other relationships that lasted about 6 months. Both of those women told me they were ""falling for me."" But it was taking me a long time to get there...

I care about this woman. Much earlier on in our relationship things were going pretty fast it seemed, and I'd say I was ""falling for her."" More recently, though, it feels like my emotions have slowed down. I enjoy making her happy, doing what I can to help her, spending a lot of time with her, lots of fun stuff, etc but I can't help but think I shouldn't be taking that step regarding the son unless I am in love with her? I have a fear like, what if something happens and I've entered this kid's life as a male role model then suddenly leaving it. I feel like it's not as bad since he has his actual father around, but I still feel a sense of pressure that I don't feel totally comfortable with yet. 

I'm starting to wonder if I'm not ready to take that step now after 6 months, will I ever be??? Is it okay to do that without feeling like I'm in love? How do I even know if I'm in love!?

TLDR: Been seeing a woman for 6 months and not sure if I'm in love or if we should make it official and bring her son into the mix and become more involved in their lives.",0,1l58iwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l58iwr/how_do_i_know_if_im_in_love/
My (30F) SO (M30) has his ex-FWBs on IG. Ask him to delete or just leave it?,"My (30F) SO (M30) has his ex-FWBs on IG. Ask him to delete or just leave it?

I initially was not bothered by my SO having his ex-fwbs on IG but its beginning to get under my skin.(Recently found out he had bought his fwb a gift and has never bought me a gift, we are currently engaged - ive been feel insecure but he doesnt have any other flaws, has reassured me and is working on the gift giving aspect). 
I have floated the idea of him deleting them but i have 2 barriers:

1) I don't want to flat out ask him to delete bc I want it to be from his own volition. Otherwise, it would be unsatisfying for me

2) We have been together for a few years. I also dont want his ex-fwbs to think im suddently insecure and that they play some significant part in our relationship. therefore I am not pushing him to delete either. I think the optics wouldve been different if it was done from the get-go

Should i ask him to delete and risk not being satisfied bc it wasnt his own volition and I may come off as insecure to these other women OR keep my mouth shut and get over it bc it isnt that srs?

Tldr: should i ask my SO to delete his ex-fwbs from IG even if it makes me look insecure and i may continue to be salty that he had to be told to do this rather than it being his own choice?",0,1l58itx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l58itx/my_30f_so_m30_has_his_exfwbs_on_ig_ask_him_to/
Wife's cousin free riding at our home since 3 months,"Situation: Wife's cousin brother has been living at our place since 3+ months. He’s a New grad (graduated masters in computer science 6 months ago). IMO not working hard enough to get interviews and prepping for them. Barely does 2 hours worth of work during the day. Watches videos and is great at talking big but not following through. Doesn’t work out or meet any friends socially, just hangs out in the house all day. It’s been 3 months already of free riding with us. Wife of course feels he’s her little brother but agrees it’s annoying to have him here all the time. It’s costing us some money (groceries, occasional restaurant meals, etc.) but I’m mostly annoyed by him being around all the time in our space with no end date. He’s helpful when we pointedly ask him to do things and generally clean but of course he’s a 25M bachelor with no sense of responsibility.His parents visited us too but we didn't have time to chat about what his plan is. 

People involved: Me (33M), Wife (33F), Cousin (25M). Wife and Cousin grew up together. 

Outcome I want: Gracefully find out what his plan is and what is the end date of his time staying at our place. Want him gone but don't want to burn the relationship in any manner.

TL;DR: Wife's Cousin brother free-riding and overstaying our hospitality, want him gone but save the relationship.

"Do I break up with my girlfriend after everything we’ve been through? (19M, 17F)","We can call her B. I (19M) and she (17F) have known each other for over 3 years, and we’ve had a very rocky history. We didn’t even meet in person until late 2023. There were long periods where we didn’t talk, or she blocked me, or I blocked her. Still, I always came back because something in me believed we were meant to be.

In late 2023, we finally met in person. I was so nervous and excited—I knew she was the one. We officially started dating on November 18, 2023. I got my license in May and started seeing her more often, like every 2-3 days.

But May was also a really bad month. I felt trapped and insecure, and I lashed out emotionally. I hung out with a random girl for about 30 minutes. Nothing physical happened at all, but the girl caught feelings and later lied to my girlfriend saying we hooked up. B believed her. That broke something between us.

I never kissed, touched, or did anything physical or sexual with anyone. I just made a stupid decision to talk to someone else. I know it was wrong. But I never stopped loving B, and I’ve done everything I can to earn her trust back.

We stayed together, but she’s never fully let go of what she thinks I did. She brings it up during fights and still treats me like I’m that person. It hurts, because I’ve done everything to prove I’ve changed. I know I betrayed her trust, but I’ve never betrayed her love.

Then something else happened—she found old traces of my Grindr account. When I was younger, I used to sell explicit photos online for money. It was a messed-up thing from my past that got carried into the future, I know I could have stopped but I just didn’t and I have to live with that . I was too young to understand how serious or gross it was. She thought I was gay, and it took a long time to reassure her that I’m not.

Even after that, we’ve had 7 months without any major problems. I’ve been loyal, present, loving, and consistent. But she still looks at me with doubt. She says she forgives me, but the way she talks during arguments says otherwise. It’s affecting my self-worth and our relationship.

We’ve made plans for a future together, and I don’t want to give up. But if she can’t let go of the past, are we both just hurting each other more by staying?

TL;DR:
I (19M) have been with my girlfriend (17F) for 7 months officially but we’ve had a complicated history. I made mistakes early on (talked to another girl when I felt trapped, and had a bad online past), but I’ve changed and been loyal since. She says she forgives me but constantly brings up the past. I love her, but I feel like we’re both hurting.

How To Let Go,"Me (17F) and my boyfriend (17M) have been together for almost 2 years. And I think it's finally over. In the beginning, our relationship was great. It seemed like he really cared about me and I couldn't have been more in love. My feelings haven't changed for him at all, but I know that it's not the same for him. He ghosts me for days at a time. I haven't been able to talk to him for 3 days, even though I've been trying to reach out. All of my friends have been there while I've cried over him. I've spent mornings crying in my bathroom and being late for school because we got into an argument, usually over something stupid like me not saying good morning to him right away. And everybody at this point is like ""Why don't you just leave him?"" And it's really hard for me to explain. He's my everything, really. He was a lot of my firsts. I lost my virginity to him, he was the second person I have ever kissed, the first person I had ever gone to a school dance with. I love him so much. And recently he's been saying how we're going to get married and move in together. My home life is really crappy right now, with my stepdad leaving recently in my relationship with my mom practically non-existent. He said that we would move in together as soon as we turned 18. so I made a savings account, and I got a job, I started working long hours so I could pay rent. Honestly, the thought of having a life with somebody that I love more than anything was the only reason I got up in the morning. I've contacted him multiple times, really just asking him to tell me if he's breaking up with me or not. Because I've spent the last three nights crying. Deep down I know this relationship has been over for a while. I tried to fix things. I tried my best. But he seems so disconnected now. Really well I'm just trying to ask is how I can move on from this. I think my reaction to all of this isn't normal, just judging other people's reactions of me trying to cope with my failing relationship. I have spam called him crying and begging him to just talk to me because I didn't understand what he wanted for me, I didn't understand what I could do to make this relationship better. Of course, he never answers. It's just been so hard. This is the person who used to cry whenever I cried just because it bothered him to see me hurt. And now he'll hang up the phone when I start crying. It hurts so much. We've been off and on so long. Usually with me crying and telling him that I would do better to fix this and I would get help. Everything that I was looking forward to, all the things that made me sleep easy at night, it's all gone. I'm just devastated. Whenever I think about it finally being over, all I can think about is him treating another girl the way I wanted him to treat me. I feel like I've done so much. I've done my fair share of wrongdoings, but I have always been loyal. I've always tried to be there for him. I've been an emotional wreck just with my personal family stuff, but he gives me no Grace for that. Thinking about being without him just drives me over the edge. He's really the only person I have in my life right now, and I can't imagine loving someone else like I love him.

I (26F) am finding it hard to deal with my new partner's (28M) fantasist brother (26m),"My partner's brother is a fantasist. He lies constantly. When we first met I took a real liking to him: he reminded me of my bf, he was funny, always had a good story but on the way home my boyfriend told me none of what he was said was true. I was shocked and hurt that he had straight up lied (among other things) about having been in Afghanistan, which he had described in vivid detail.

Last weekend we attended a wedding and the stuff he was coming out with was nauseating. Apparently he worked in cinema as a sound engineer and was one of Christopher Nolan's movies. A lot of the stories he tells I'm sure he has either taken from interviews or maybe even Reddit/Twitter. Anecdotes about what ""Cillian"" (Murphy) is like in real life... some funny story about Nolan on a peleton that he told to everyone who would listen (which was basically everyone who doesn't know him)

Of course everyone else took it at face value and was saying what an interesting BIL I had. I couldn't bring myself to expose him, simply because it would have been too awkward.

"I found my bfs tiktok acc that he said only his close friends follow, but his ex follows him on it. How do i confront him about it?","So basically I (14F) found my bfs (15M) tiktok acc, that i wasn't supposed to find. He told me 'only his close friends follow it' and me and him have been dating for only 3 weeks, so we're not really 'close friend' close. He'd been complaining about how his ex (15F) followed his acc and how she's been viewing his profile and stuff. He's been sending me like some screenshots of notifications and stuff from her, that's how i found his acc. Fyi I told him to block her if she was annoying him, he changed the topic when i said that so i js assumed he did it. 

When i found his acc i went through his followers a little, saw she was still following him. Then i checked his following and saw he followed her back. He only has 5 followers and follows 4 people. He was with her right before me btw, and he complained to me abt how they'd argue all the time, she wasn't answering his texts, etc. Btw he blocked her on insta, i have his insta login, he showed me a glance of his messages so i know they're not texting. Also him and his ex aren't close friends i know that, she literally lives across the whole state.

**TL;DR;** My bf has a tiktok acc for his close friends, that i'm not supposed to know about. His ex who i thought he blocked still follows him and he follows her back. I'm worried they might still be in contact.

my best friend seeing someone from my (our) past…,"Me (24f) and my best friend (22f)  have been besties since my sophomore year of highschool. During the time when we first became friends — she was dating my step brother. Well as the years went on, they ended things and we stayed friends.
Eventually, my stepfather ends up cheating on my mom and therefore leading to their divorce. This entire time my best friend stood by me and my mom & supported us. The past few years my best friend has NOT liked my ex-step brother and has talked pretty negatively about him. However flash forward to now, she just got out of a 5 year relationship and now all of a sudden has no issue with my ex- step brother, no issue with my ex- stepdad, and just told me she is going out with my ex step brother and his mom & sister to celebrate his moms birthday. Approximately 17 years ago, this woman attempted to run me and my mother off the road, verbally harassed us, and chased us through town (which SEVERELY traumatized me and my mother) - and my best friend knows this whole story... yet is going to celebrate her birthday? I know i can't control my friends lives, and I am talking with my therapist about this extensively — but how is that not supposed to bother me? This woman could have ended me and my mother's lives and she didn't care, and now the person I call my best friend is just gonna go hang with her? She keeps saying “your family stuff doesn’t involve me” and while shes right it doesn’t, at what point do you say “this person hurt my best friend I cannot be around them?” Please tell me im being dramatic and I am reading too far into things.

Do i say something to her? If so, what tf do i say…? TIA

Is it my (27F) place to tell my brother (31M) to start helping our mom (58F) financially since he lives with her?,"Short family lore: my family is tiny, toxic, and dysfunctional. My parents (64M, 58F) are divorced and I (27F) live out of the house with a roommate. My brother (31M) lives with our physically disabled mom in a double wide. He’s lived with her for the past 8 years. His gf lived there with him for years as well and they both didn’t help my mom out with squat and they recently broke up so gf moved out.

My brother pays for NOTHING besides his car and insurance. Not the high speed internet that he had our mom switch to, not the electricity for the thermostat that he controls, not the property taxes, not water/garbage/etc…. Nothing. Our mom even pays his phone bill and lets him use her food stamps. My mom is on social security and works a temporary part-time job for about a month a few times a year, so she makes just enough to get by.

My brother makes double what I make, and I have quadruple the bills he has. He spends all of his money on dumb crap like expensive guns, bows, computer parts, and random stuff he doesn’t need. He makes more than enough to help her financially.

My mom has TOLD ME that she’s struggling to get by and I’ve basically screamed at her to start demanding rent from him but she’s such an enabler and always says something like “ohhhh I would feel so bad, I make enough to get by so there’s no need to ask him.” And the few times she has asked him in the past, apparently he ignores her. I’ve told her that she needs to demand rent or kick him out but she refuses. He has 2 kids that he gets every other weekend and she feels like she will never see them if she kicks him out, but even if he didn’t have kids I know she wouldn’t.

My mom does care for both of us, but I’ve long since accepted that she has a favorite child and it’s not me. For example, I’ve asked to use her food stamps when I’m financially struggling and been turned down, but I check our shared Walmart account and see her letting my brother use them to order $200+ worth of expensive meat every few weeks.

So, at this point, I want to message him and tell him how I feel about it. The thing is, I’m unfortunately very non-confrontational and don’t want to get into a screaming match with my brother. And I know that my mom will side with him in the end, so I don’t know if it’s even worth my time to start this. But I am extremely uncomfortable with the entire situation.

Can I please get some advice?

TL;DR: 31M brother lives with disabled 58F mom and doesn’t help at all despite her barely getting by - in fact, mom practically pays him to live there by paying his bills. Mom is an enabler and refuses to ask him for money despite him making more than enough to help.

i (23F) want to separate from my bf (23M) after the death of a parent,"i (23F) have been with my bf (23M) for a little over two years and have been living together for about 8 months. we live together in a city about an hour and a half from my hometown and mom. about two weeks ago my father passed away and it has been a difficult time. i have had this tiny voice in my head that i should breakup with my bf bc i am just over it, but i am not sure if this is genuinely how i feel or if this is more related to my fathers passing and my emotions are running high. he is a great guy and we have fun, but living with him is not what i think i want anymore. he is quite messy and very rarely picks up after himself. the most he will do is the dishes. i am quite neat so i get frustrated when i am picking up empty cans or have to clean the bathroom sink of his shaved facial hair. he smokes weed almost everyday, and i dont care because i partake sometimes, but it seems everyday he just smokes and plays video games and thats all he does. he will sit in discord and play games with his friends for hours and we live in a studio so i have nowhere to go when he is gaming. i know my emotions are all over the place because of my dads death, but i am having a hard time differentiating what i am genuinely feeling and what is just a rash emotion from my heightened emotional state. it’s also very personal, but sometimes i don’t feel sexually motivated with him. i am unsure if my low libido is from my antidepressants or just grief or if i genuinely am not sexually attracted to him. 

also i just recently got a new job in this new city we are living in together. if i move back in with my mom, then i have to quit my job and it took me about 6 months to find the one i have now. i can’t afford to live anywhere in the city by myself with how expensive housing is and don’t have any friends in the area i can live with. i don’t feel comfortable living with a facebook roommate being a single female myself. i am at a loss. i have been feeling not happy with the living situation for a bit but i just push it away bc i know i have a problem with control. the mess, his smoking habits, the lack of sexual attraction and just attitude when we have a problem are all less than ideal things that have shown up since living together. it also doesn’t help that i hate the apt we live in. how do i know if what i am feeling is genuine or if this is just a reaction to my fathers passing?

Is my relationship normal?,"I '21F' is in a 4 month relationship with my bf '20M'. We study in the same uni. So to talk about the first month or two things have been going pretty great. He did pay for my first date and from the second date onwards we split the bill which I was fine with (now on a slightly diff note in my previous relationships I had never really split the bills and it was all my boyfriends who paid for me and I never said anything about) so this time I decided that I'd do things differently and maybe who knows things might work out better. 


Fast forward to the last month in May things started changing a bit weirdly. We never really used to have deep everyday conversations via text, it was fairly regular ones where we use to send one time pictures to inform about our day but the gaps in between the texts slowly increased to 7 hr or 6 hrs on an average everyday. He lives pretty far away and doesn't attend classes so didn't meet him in person as such. 
The incident which kinda left me weirded out was one night he asked me if I was free to accompany him for drinks after classes to which I readily agreed and I was happy to finally go out on a date with him after so long (bit of a backstory we were supposed to go out on a date a week back but he cancelled it because he wanted to meet his best friend whom he hadn't met in quite a few days and although I was a bit sad I wasn't angry because I understood his best friend was imp to him, and he said a very distinct thing at that time which I quote is ""I'd always prefer friendships rather than relationships because relationships are very fragile which friendships are not"")


The next day after classes were over we were leaving when before leaving he went upto his best friend and almost commanded him to go with us who at first was hesitant but was polite enough to ask my permission if i was okay with him accompanying. To be polite I did say yes although I felt a bit off. Now we had to take an auto which was around 14 rupees. I had 10 in my hand so that's what I gave my boyfriend who immediately stated asking me for 4 rupees more to which I playfully denied. He then said I'll cut this money from the cigarette I'll buy you (he buys me one cigarette a day if he meets me which costs 17 rupees) I again didn't think much about it. The entire time during the date I was mostly talking to his best friend who was polite enough to make conversations with me and both him and I were the ones who talked the most while my bf sitting beside me just drank in silence. On our way out he in front of the cigarette shop gave me two choices 1. If I would pay 7 rupees and he'll give 10 to balance out the auto fare or I pay 160 in total along with the drinks ( I had ordered a 150 rupee drink and he wanted 10 rupees more for making him buy cigarette) and that night we had the longest conversation in the whole entire month which was all about him asking me for the 160 constantly and telling me how he's very calculative with money because he's an economics student and he doesn't like owing anyone anything or anyone owing him anything. What I cannot figure out is how different this relationship is and if thus relationship is actually how things are supposed to be done and all my previous relationships were just me being a gold digger.

TL;DR: 
My boyfriend makes me pay even for the slightest of things like auto fares or bus rides and always makes sure to say that he's not paying for me if we go out somewhere to eat randomly.",1,1l53jnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l53jnw/is_my_relationship_normal/
I (M19) told my girlfriend (F20) I'm uncomfortable with her hanging out with a guy who invited her to hangout but she's still going to do it,"Me and her have been together for 9 months so far and she already knows how I feel about her hanging out with guys one and one, so she doesn't. She feels the same way with me too. But in her words, he is a longtime friend of hers who she's known since middle school and also a family friend with her family. I've never met him. In my opinion, I just feel like it was a little innappropriate to ask her to hang out alone and smoke weed together when he knows she has a boyfriend. But anyways, she asked if I could be there (which made me feel pretty good and was cool of her) and he said ""why wouldn't he be able to"" as in like a nice gesture I guess. But after he couldn't come last night, he invited her again to hang out and smoke the next day but with another girl that my gf also knows, and it would just be the 3 of them probably in his basement or something (accordinf to my gf). She was very accepting about it and this time didn't say anything about me coming along. 

I just feel like this kind of feels wrong and is a little disrespectful for both parties, but maybe im overthinking it since everyone has different boundaries? I don't know, but I feel like as a guy, no matter who you are to a girl, you should be more mindful that she's in a relationship and you're just inviting girls to hang out with you without thinking (especially since she posts me a lot on her snapchat). I also don't like how he immediately wanted to smoke with her the day of instead of planning something ahead of time and was just like planning on smoking the same night that they were talking. It happened literally out of nowhere.

Anyways, I told her how I feel about it, and she said she understands my perspective, but doesn't see anything bad about it, so she still might go do it. I don't really know how to feel now but obviously I can't tell her she can't go and do that because that would be controlling.  Idk what to do.

Struggling with feelings after finding out someone I’ve grown close to is also talking to other girls,"I 19F , (never been in a relationship before) met this guy 22M on Reddit about 5 months before starting my semester abroad. We started talking because he went to the same university that I was going to. Our conversations quickly became deep and we talked for hours every day, and I felt a connection I’d never felt with anyone before.

At first, I just wanted to be friends. But he flirted often, saying things like “will you marry me?” and playful compliments. and over time, I started developing feelings too. Still, he’d occasionally ghost me for 2–3 days, saying he was busy. I tried to be understanding because when he did come back, we’d pick up where we left off and have a great time again.

Once I finally arrived for my exchange semester, things were amazing. We met almost every day. We explored the city, laughed a lot, and made so many memories together. He brought me small gifts, like chocolates when I was on my period, took me to cool places (even flew me somewhere cool), and spent hours just hanging out. We had a few arguments, he would sometimes raise his voice or get pushy, but always apologized afterward. I felt so close to him. We started doing sleepovers and cuddling (which he initiated), and that deepened my feelings.

As the end of my semester got closer, I started feeling really low. The thought of leaving and possibly never seeing him again was breaking my heart. I opened up to him during a sleepover, crying, telling him how I felt — but he didn’t seem too affected. I wanted to spend as much time with him as I could before I left, but he didn’t seem to feel the same urgency. I wanted to confess my feelings, but every time I got close, he’d ghost me again or cancel plans without warning. When we did meet, though, things would go back to being wonderful, and I’d forgive him again.

Then last night, He invited me for another sleepover. We were cuddling, things felt amazing and pure, but he kept checking his phone more than usual. I never thought much of it before since he talks to his friends, but something felt off. When he left the room, I glanced at his notifications. There were texts from FOUR different girls — nothing explicit, but they looked eerily similar to how our conversations began. They were asking why he hadn’t replied, telling him about their day — the same emotional tone I used to have with him early on.

My heart sank.

This entire time, he made me feel like I was his favorite person. He got me gifts, spent so much time with me, invited me for special days, telling me that he only wanted to spend time with me on his birthday for example, constantly told me how much he loved being with me, and even joked about marrying me. Now I don’t know if any of that was real.

I feel so confused and hurt. I genuinely thought we had something special, and I’m still deeply attached to him. But after seeing those messages, I feel disrespected. I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable for expecting loyalty even though we weren’t “official.” Part of me wants to confront him. Another part doesn’t want to ghost him in the few days I have left. My friends say I should take space and protect myself, but I’m struggling to process all this. Or I could just try acting normal and stay friends with him without any expectations because I do have a great time with hime

I’d really appreciate any advice. Should I talk to him about what I saw? Is it okay that I feel betrayed when we were technically just friends? I just don’t know what to do.




TL;DR:
I (19F) grew close to a guy (22M) I met online before my semester abroad. We spent a lot of time together and got emotionally close, with cuddling and flirting, though we weren’t officially dating. Now that I’m about to leave, I found out he’s been texting multiple other girls in a similar way, and I feel hurt and confused. Not sure if I should talk to him, take space, or just stay friendly until I leave.

"When do you know it’s time to leave? Been living together 2 years with an immature man (24F, 27M)","

Been with my boyfriend 4 years, living together for 2. I’m 24, he’s 27. Lately I’ve been questioning if I see a future anymore.

He takes very little initiative. He’s a surface level cleaner like does the pots here and there, hoovers sometimes but never as much as I do. Never deep cleans, never makes the bed, rarely checks the cat’s litter tray never mind deep clean that, and doesn’t seem to notice when things need doing. I work full-time in an office (2 days WFH), and even with his job being demanding, he finishes earlier and is usually home an hour before me. He doesn’t cook tea ready for when I get back, or surprise me with anything like even a cup of tea or small acts of service, which I really value.

He doesn’t take life seriously he’s quite immature in that sense. He’s always joking or acting silly, which can be fun, but it’s constant. There’s rarely a calm or emotionally present version of him. He often jokes at my expense in a flat voice with no expression, so it doesn’t even sound like a joke then insists it is when I question it. He admits he likes winding me up.

A huge red flag for me was when he admitted to me (after I questioned him months after the fact) that he used to criticise my driving when I’d just passed my test because his ego was hurt and he can’t drive and he felt behind in life and miserable. He says he feels bad about it, but I can’t shake it.

His mum still rings him every morning to wake him up for work (even when she’s on holiday), does his work laundry because he just doesn’t, sometimes makes his lunch, and everyday drives him to work and back. He doesn’t drive, and shows no urgency to start even though he could afford it especially now with his promotion. I’ve asked him to set boundaries with his mum and he tried once but she said she wants to help us out.

Sex feels okay but no emotional connection. It seems based around him being horny and needing to get off. He asks constantly, even if I’ve said no, or makes comments just because he’s horny. I try to brush off when he hints at sex because I just don’t like it anymore. I’m not sure if this is just what four year long relationship sex feels like?

I will say he’s funny, we have really similar humour and hobbies, he does make me laugh, and he can be cute with me like everyday. He pays for meals out or events because he knows I can’t afford it. But when it comes to the home, it feels very unbalanced and like I’m carrying most of it. And I can’t tell if that’s going to change.

We have a cat we love, and there’s work to do on the house before we could sell. I think that’s why I’m hesitating. I also really like his parents and hate the thought of upsetting them. But if I’m already feeling this drained now… how would I cope with kids?

TL;DR:
24F, 27M. Together 4 years, living together 2. He rarely helps around the house unless asked, doesn’t deep clean or care for the cat, relies heavily on his mum, constantly jokes or makes sexual comments, and lacks emotional maturity. There are good moments, but I’m struggling to picture a future.

I (23F) badly needs any advice on my relationship with my girlfriend (27F),"I (23F) badly needs any advice on my relationship with my girlfriend (27F)

It is currently 3 AM as I am writing this so I hope you all know how badly I need to pour this out. So I have a girlfriend of almost 6 years, but we've just recently met in a physical sense since we were on a very long distance relationship. She was great in terms of taking care of me since when I started my internship, she'd been the one to support me financially because I have a poor relationship with my family. I greatly appreciate her but when it comes down to us being partners, it seems... off. She seems off. 

She's not one to show any romantic gestures because this is her first real relationship. It actually took her this long to have the courage to bring our relationship into the ""real world"" and now have me meet her family. The thing is, during our LDR, she's sweet beyond world. She used to write me songs, used to sing to me, used to write me poems. We used to know each other to our very core. But now it feels like she isn't the same person. She's very cold when we're together. I try my best to give her the chance to get used to us and I really do respect her boundaries and all but it's so hard when I see her get joyous, sweet, and caring towards other people outside of her family. 

I've just recently found out about her relationship with a few of her co-workers. Her phone is full of their photos and their conversation is full of inside jokes and all. She shares tiktk videos to one girl, like memes and all, and they do it back and forth. She used to be like that with me but now I only do it and she barely acknowledges it. And then I also saw her say that she's with a co-worker during her duty today and she said that ""we're just here being clingy with one another"" and then sent a photo of the girl and her with the girl. They were watching the hunger games which a movie we both love and I had been asking her to re-watch it with me but she never have the time to. Today also, and every morning that I am here with her, I cook her breakfast and pack her lunch. I wake up very early to do that. When she's at work, she doesn't text me at all. I just wait for her to update me or even check up on me. She never does. She goes home to me with a frown on her face always saying she's tired. She will then proceed to take a very long time inside the bathroom with her phone. When she's out, I try to make conversation and try to act sweet and all but she barely talks to me. When she holds her phone she's always laughing. When I talk to her, you can tell she's not as enthusiastic with me. I don't know what's happening since I have confronted her multiple times now if she just doesn't love me anymore. She just keep on saying she does but it doesn't feel that way.

I honestly don't know what to do and what to feel anymore. 

Can you please give me advice on what to do?

I(18M) still have feelings for a friend(18F) after graduation,"
I recently just graduated high school and for most of my time there I had a crush on a friend which I developed in the middle of sophomore year after becoming friends with her in the middle of freshman year. I started developing feelings for her when friends of mine and hers thought we already were a thing which I realized I liked the idea of. I would eventually confess said feelings a bit later and she stated “that she wasn’t interested in a relationship at that moment.” We stayed friends after that but I guess our friendship just declined as I was too awkward about it. We basically for the most part outright stopped talking.

Apparently according to a close friend of mine I came off as “creepy” which was the word that likely got around the school. Whether that was hyperbole or truly how she truly felt I do not know. Regardless I felt really bad about that, I never realized I went far.

Fast forward to senior year and well we went from having no interactions to being a friend (not good friends but a friend) and talked every now and then maybe 1-2 times a week. While I did often initiate these things she also initiated interactions too. As an example she pointed out how we were twinning in prom due to us coincidentally wearing matching outfits (both outfits were of the same color). She also tried to get me to dab on stage during graduation.

Now that graduation is over we likely will never organically interact with each other. Especially since she is going to another school 4 hours away and I’ll be staying here at our home town. I do have her number and I guess I just wanted to get some kind of closure. To maybe just apologize for the awkwardness I might’ve caused. Plus I’ve just been holding on to this for so long and I want to do something.

On the other hand this is me over thinking for the course of almost 3 years. Maybe this isn’t a big deal and maybe I should just let it go?

TL;DR

Had a long standing crush on a high school friend. Confessed in sophomore year, she wasn’t interested, and things got awkward as our friendship declined. Later heard I came off as “creepy,” which really hurt. We reconnected a bit during senior year, had some friendly interactions like prom and graduation, but now we’ve graduated and are going to different colleges. I still think about her, want to maybe apologize and get closure, but I’m unsure if reaching out is the right move or if I should just let it go.",1,1l519w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l519w4/i18m_still_have_feelings_for_a_friend18f_after/
I (22 F) temporarily lose feelings and attraction towards bf,"I (22 F) have been dating my bf (23 M) for about a year. He's getting his PhD in Seattle while I live in LA, but we see each other fairly often so we're semi LDR. Idk why but every once in a while, specifically right now, I get this feeling out of nowhere where I feel completely disconnected. In these short periods I lose feelings / my sexual attraction towards my bf, but he hasn't done anything wrong to make me feel this disconnect so I don't know why this happens! And then a few days later everything goes back to normal.

I don't want to lead him on or feel like I'm trapping myself with someone I'm not super into all the time, so I'm debating if I should end things.

HOWEVER! for more background: I've always had these short periods where I feel complete romantic/detachment from my partner for no reason in my past relationships. In my first relationship (<2 yrs) I was 15-16, and I ended things after he went to college because I just ""wasn't feeling it anymore"" even though he never did anything objectively wrong. My last relationships (~4.5 yrs) 17-21, I was always very attracted to him. I never had the loss of feelings stages until after like 2 years of us dating, but this was when his toxic/manipulative tendencies started showing (but I stayed and made excuses for him bc we went through so much together). I truly was starting to dislike him towards the end of our relationship, and then I ended things when I realized he wasn't going to change. Anyway that last relationship left me super traumatized lol. I'm also wondering if these dry spells/detachment periods happen because of my hormonal fluctuations (I get very bad PMS symptoms and recently started Nexplanon) in combination with my ADHD.

Fast forward to my relationship now, he is truly the best partner I have ever had. He is loving, caring, funny, emotionally intelligent, driven in his life, is always validating my feelings and is attentive toward me and puts effort into our relationship. Yet out of nowhere I'll just wake up and not really be feeling him, but I've also had this tendency in my past relationships. I really don't want to feel regret if I end things with him because he's so amazing, but do I stay with him is these feelings exist or are these normal feelings to have? Please I need advice

Tl;dr I love my bf. We’ve been dating almost a year and he’s the best partner I’ve ever had, but I go through short periods where I lose my feelings/attraction towards him (this has happened in my past relationships, maybe there’s something clinically wrong with me idk).

How do I (31f) talk to my husband (33m) about how truly unhappy I am in our marriage?,"I feel like my marriage is less of a marriage, and more of a roommate situation anymore. We have been married for four years, together for ten.

My husband has never been one to share much about how he is feeling, but over the past year it has evolved to where he just doesn't share anything. When I talk to him about my day, it feels like I'm hoisting a chore upon him to listen. When I ask him about his day, it's always the same ""It was good.""

There have been things going on on his side of the family, that he had not bothered to share with me. Big important to talk about things, that I won't go into detail about because this is a burner account, that I had no clue that were happening until a relative of his called me to talk about it.

My husband had a medical issue that he downplayed, and when he finally got attention for it, he told me nothing about. I was finding out information about my own husband's medical issues second hand. When I would try to talk with him, he would just shut me down, stating that he didn't want to worry me or that he didn't want to talk about it.

It is at the point where we just exist in each other's lives, but it doesn't feel like we're actively part of it. The only time he ""communicates"" is after he's had a few beverages.

He doesn't want to be an active part of my family anymore, anytime I go to visit family or if there is a family event, he won't come with me.

I feel like we slipped into complacency, and are now just drifting apart.

Our sex life is nonexistent. We haven't been intimate since July of last year, and that can barely be called sex because he couldn't maintain an erection. The interaction felt forced, and left us both frustrated.

I know we haven't gotten to this place in our marriage on his actions alone. I went through a depression just after we got married, and simmered in it gor longer than I should have before helping myself. I have anxiety in overly large social settings, and I know that has made certain situations not so fun for him. The thing that burns me though, is that I've tried. When behaviors I had were effecting him negatively, I actively worked to improve myself and work to see how my behaviors effect those around me. He has not.

Our daily interactions are him coming home from work, us sitting in a room together on our phones, reading, or watching tv. Half the time he sleeps on the couch. We don't actively do things together. Ever. We don't go out on dates, or do things together for fun.

I am married and I am so lonely.

I have tried talking to him about our relationship, and he either shuts it down completely, or blows up and says that I'm the one at fault for my unhappiness. I feel as though I'm married to a stranger, and I'm at a loss for what to do.

Is my relationship toxic/controlling? Is it salvageable?,"
I (27M) have been with my (26F) girlfriend for 3 years and we had been living together previously but I moved out because of issues in our relationship and my lack of communication had a hand in it but not completely the reason and we’re back together but living apart and I’m having issues and feel as these may be controlling traits but I’m biased so I wanted to get a second opinion. Here’s some notes I made about our issues currently. 

Guilt Tripping:

Says she feels as if she isn’t my #1 priority and is upset when I make decisions on my own. Also, makes me feel less than her says the guy should always be the reacher and when I compliment her she’ll often say I know I am rather than thank me or compliment me also which I think is a little cocky. 

Spending time away:

When I don’t invite her to something I wanted to do one on one with my friends or family and makes me feel bad and will be upset when I want my space. Will say she probably would have said no anyways but it’s nice to be asked and has been a fight multiple times. One time I was away from home when we lived together to visit some of our family members graves and go to the beach with my sister and brother and she had a bad day at work and because I didn’t call her or go home earlier she was mad and ended up yelling at me in the car after. I was texting her though on my sisters phone since mine died and said I was sorry she was having a hard time and that since I was with family when I got home she can tell me all about her day. (A year later she’s still upset about that and thinks I’m in the wrong but we don’t talk about it due to different opinions)

Cheating:

Constant fear of me cheating. I have never cheated. Used to make comments frequently but no longer does after a discussion but will ask what I’m doing on my phone and when I answer sometimes she thinks it comes off weird and suspicious or sounds like a lie. 

Living and working arrangements:

I'm torn in between wanting to break up with my bf or stay together,"Me '27F' bf '28M' we have been together for more than 3 years. We are currently together. We have been having a difficult relationship this year. My mom passed away from a long time illness recently. Less than 2 months ago and bf didn't come to her funeral. He said he doesn't believe in funerals due to his beliefs and would feel uncomfortable. I told him i need him there for support and he said to me i have my family there so why do i need him. He is not a family person. I am very close to my family. He stopped visiting my mom and family about a year ago. He told me he doesn't see the point in being there. This has caused issues between us. We live together. 

I was close to leaving him and breaking up because I was fed up. He could have just come there for me but he didn't. We are still together because we had a long conversation about everything. He told me he would change and hang out with my family and do more. He told me he wants to get married to me. I decided to try one more time but I still have resentment. How do I know he will be there in my time of need if something like this occurs again? 

This is one of the hardest times in my life.

I think my best friend hates me and I don’t know what to do about it,"Okay so a little background. In 2021 I (F23) joined a discord server and through that made a very tight knit little friend group which most importantly included someone I have considered a best friend who we’ll call Alex (NB24) and they hosted the server we met in. For about 3 years our friend group talked every single day and video called most days, more recently it’s slowed down due to jobs and school. In 2024 the first server got too full of people who were inactive or we just didn’t want to interact with so we made our own server with our main friend group and some other friends that would come and go.

Now this server is where some issues started. Because Alex created both servers they added some friends that were very much just their friends not friends of the rest of the group. Alex shares a common interest with these friends that very few people in the group share, and those who do aren’t anywhere near as into it as Alex. (Just to get ahead of any comments I don’t care that Alex has an interest that I don’t have, people like different things that’s fine, I also don’t care that Alex has friends that aren’t part of the group.) 

The issue became that these friends basically only came onto the server to talk about this interest with Alex and didn’t talk to anyone else in the server, in fact they generally interrupted to talk about their thing whenever other people were having conversations with Alex instead of waiting or going onto a different channel to discuss it so Alex could have both conversations simultaneously without either person interrupting the others convo. It always felt like they were pushing into our space and didn’t care for the rest of the group and I never understood why they couldn’t have their own server. These friends were also very childish, on one instance we were on a video call and they kept using the soundboard over and over again and we told them to stop repeatedly because there are several autistic people in our group (including myself) who found it very overstimulating but they continued to do it.

I discussed the friends with other people in the group and they felt the same way I did. This behaviour happened for months until I finally had enough and unfortunately snapped. I will preface this by saying I know I handled this wrong and I should have worded it better. When we were discussing the incident above in DMs I said to them “I’m sorry bro but your friends are annoying as hell.” I immediately followed it up with a message apologising and saying that it didn’t come out the way I intended it. They then replied saying “It’s okay don’t worry, I know you didn’t mean to be rude. I like talking to them but I get they might be annoying to you.” I then explained my feelings further talking about the way they constantly speak over us. 

We discussed for a while longer before coming to the conclusion that they would make a channel for talking about their common interest and I thought the problem was solved. A few days later Alex DM’d me saying “I’ve been thinking about what you said to me and honestly deciding it was a good idea to tell me to my face you find my friends ‘fucking annoying’ was one of the meanest things you could’ve done. I know you said you didn’t mean to be rude but that kinda just makes it worse.” I totally didn’t expect this because I felt we’d worked things out but I guess not. I replied “Fuck I'm so sorry I really didn't mean for it to come out the way it did, I was just at the end of my rope because I was afraid I was losing you as a friend and I went about it in the worst way possible and said something I didn't really mean which was awful and it hurt you and I'm really sorry that I upset you. as you can probably guess I have some issues regarding friends moving on and growing apart, and I took it out on you and i'm so incredibly sorry for that.” 

Those messages are actually much longer and go into depth a bit more about our feelings but I don’t feel comfortable sharing the full messages but we very much talked through it and made up. Everything went pretty much back to normal except we were a little more distant with each other. 

Now 4 months later they’ve become really distant with me like borderline ignoring me, they won’t start conversations with me and pretty much only talk to me when I directly @ them or reply to them. I also recently stopped speaking in the server for a week or two because I was having a pretty rough time, while I was gone several other friends sent me messages asking if I was okay, when I’d be back, where I went (Which is usually what everyone including Alex does if someone doesn’t say anything for a few days). Alex didn’t send a single message. I thought we were okay but I can’t help but shake the feeling that they’re done with me. I can’t think of anything else I could have done to upset them. I really don’t want to lose them they’re one of my favourite people in the world and I don’t think I can stay in that server if they hate me. 

TL;DR I said my best friend’s other friends were annoying, we fought, we made up. But now 4 months later they’re ignoring me.",0,1l4rd5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l4rd5u/i_think_my_best_friend_hates_me_and_i_dont_know/
I (40F)am disabled due to multiple sclerosis. My husband (42M) is starting to be decent. How I deal with him or help him open up?,"ETA: it should be “distant” not “decent” in title

My husband (42M) and I (40F)married nine years ago. A year later, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. My condition has worsened to the point where I use a wheelchair full time.

My husband has always been by my side as I’ve went from walking with canes and crutches to using wheelchair. Two months ago, I made the decision to have a urinary catheter placed. That’s been hard on my husband as it’s another reminder of how my condition has worsened.

My husband has been distant lately and sometimes shows signs of bitterness. He told me recently how he feels he can’t connect to his married guy friends because none of them have a disabled wife. 

I do what I can to be self sufficient at home and will only ask for help from my husband if it’s absolutely needed. We have had to have parts of our home modified to be more wheelchair accessible. We both constantly worry about me reaching a point where I can’t take care of myself at all.,

In the past couple of months, my husband has become more distant.

I have suggested therapy in the past and my husband is opposed to it because he grew up with a father who believes that “men should just deal with problems on their own” and be stoic.
 

Are there any people who have been in similar situations?

"I (25F) and my partner (26M) have some issues which show incompatibility, though overall we are happy. How should I communicate to save this relationship or is walking away more respectful?","We have been dating for an year. We are amazing at conversations and intimacy is pretty fun. But there are some things that make me a bit nervous, and I am quite confused.

He is very horny for me and says he loves me like crazy. But I have said no to certain physical advances - but he still persists, by asking multiple times and bargaining. I gave in, and it is fun when it happens, but I am conflicted. I have him I am not comfortable with some stuff before marriage, so he says he wont do it - but he talks about it a lot (like going to the 3rd/4th base).

This is one thing, but then we have fought over some other stuff too. If it is my mistake, I would apologize for long hours, make up to him but that would exhaust me. But at the end it would get resolved.

My concern is that if he wants me to do something after we get married, he would be able to make me do it. I can try to convince him, stand my ground but somewhere that would hurt him and make him feel less important. I am not fully convinced about my autonomy after marriage, despite being financially independent.

I dont want to breakup because I love him, he cares for me and is an amazing person overall, and he would be so hurt but this gut feeling keeps pinching me. He has been a great friend, and he knows a lot about me and vice versa. He is a rock and makes me so confident and happy.

Somewhere I have a fear of bad marriage, seeing my family so I am concerned if this is not sabotaging a perfectly good thing.

Is there a better way I can communicate, or make this work out?

I am hiding a secret from my partner that feels too late to tell,"I (27f) and my partner (27m) have been together for 5 years. We met in college. I will give a rough timeline here. This is a messy situation and im not proud of who I was back then. Its okay to like sex and be free but i truly regret how everything has come to be.

At the time (2020) my ex Troy introduced me to my friend Zion with the intention of us hooking up. Zion and I hooked up over the course of maybe 2-3 weeks, until Troy admitted he had feelings for me and could not watch this happen. Troy and I started dating, and the three of us stayed friends. Despite Zion and I previously sleeping together we realized we were actually great friends, and (i thought) we were mature enough to have moved past that. There was absolutely no funny business while i was dating Troy. Zion also introduced me to his friends. And we all became great friends. Troy and i broke up after about 6-7 months. Zion was my friend through the breakup, still absolutely no funny business, except for one weak night but other than that back to business. I was also still close to the friend group.

Maybe a month or two after I broke up with Troy  i met my current partner, Dan. I did not date him for another 6 months as i was still a mess, but i introduced him to my entire friend group which included Zion. We have now all been friends for YEARS.

I have recently found out Zion has been making sexual comments about me behind my back  for years. Everyone finds it uncomfortable and it became enough that one of these friends finally told me. I did not feel the need to tell Dan about Zion and i’s previous relationship both because it was short, before i met him, and we were platonic friends for months and then years with nothing to it. But to find out Zion has been disrespecting me and my relationship for so long now makes me feel incredibly bad. It feels like its too late to tell Dan but i’m worried it will come out. If dan finds out our relationship will end and im terrified. It most likely wont come out but now the guilt is eating me alive. But it also feels selfish because maybe I only want to tell him now to appease my own guilt?

Dan has also become great friends with these people and to find out everyone knew but him will hurt. 

It should be clear that Zion is no longer my friend after finding this out. The other people in the friend group also no longer want to be his friend both because of this and other reasons. Zion is done in my life. But what should i do?

Tl;dr i am in a friend group with a man i have slept with and my bf dan doesnt know. It feels too late to tell him (my own fault). What should i do?

"My [23M] partner has not been sexually intimate with me, and it's making me feel disconnected and struggle with my relationship.","My partner \[23M\]  has avoided me \[21M\] for the past half a year in terms of sexual intimacy. I have been with him for about 1.5 years, and he is my first boyfriend. To clarify, the extent of our physical intimacy has been a peck kiss and or hand holding when I see him. Everything beyond that, like sex or even just making out has not happened for more than half a year. Physical touch is my love language, and it is important to me in a relationship. I have expressed it to him, and he knows that. 

For context, he's explained to me that his parents' recent struggle in their relationship has taken a toll on his drive for intimacy, stating that it's made him stressed about his situation. Moreover, he has been dealing with anxiety and levels of depression for the greater part of his life, which could also be an underlying factor. That said, during the beginning of our relationship, his parents were already struggling with their relationship, all the while, we had a regular sex life. Even if it wasn't sex, our moments of intimacy would include longer kisses or other intimate acts. I guess I am confused about the connection between me and him and him and his parents. 

 I don't understand what I can do to bring back his drive and have the same intimate moments we used to have. I have brought this up many times, and on different occasions, he has brought up the same reason about his family dynamic. That said, I don't understand how it would relate to our sex life or just kissing in general.  The last time I brought this issue up was a month ago, and he said the same thing about his family, paired with the fact that we were not having enough quality time, thus he feels like he isn't compelled to be sexually intimate with me. I made a conscious effort to try to see him more and spend more time, having more meaningful and engaging conversations, all the while trying to be present, yet to no avail. I always want to respect his boundary and always will, but I feel like it is now at a point where it is affecting my perception and value of myself. I feel undervalued and less loved without sexual and physical intimacy. This is my first relationship, and I love and care for him deeply. That said, I cannot imagine myself in a relationship with no physical closeness on a sexual level. I do not want this to be the reason I leave a relationship, because I feel like I am being selfish and not understanding. However, I also need to respect myself enough and make sure that I am in a relationship where I am fulfilled. 

Deep down, I feel like the reasons he has listed aren't the main reasons and that he has fallen out of love with me. I feel like he no longer loves me, even though he says he does. 

I am unsure what I should do. Do I leave after a certain amount of time? Or should I bring it up how it bothers me one last time? Or has anyone experienced something similar and had a specific way of communicating? This is my first relationship, and I'm not sure if there is a way to go about this. I would appreciate some of your guys' help. Thank you. 

  
TL;DR: 

My partner (23M) has avoided intimacy for 6+ months, despite me (21M) expressing that physical touch is important. He blames family issues and his anxiety, but we were intimate even when his parents were struggling. I’ve tried to spend more time with him, but I feel undervalued and unsure if he still loves me.

Struggling with a Friend Who Read My Journal,"
Hi everyone,

I’m going through a tough situation and could really use some advice.

I (27F) had a close friend (also 27F) for 7 years, but over the last year, I’ve been feeling increasingly drained and stressed in the friendship. To cope, I started journaling about my feelings, including some raw and unfiltered thoughts about how the friendship was affecting me. I wrote about how I didn’t always feel good in it, how I felt stuck and stressed, and how I needed space to understand my own emotions.

Recently, she found and read my journal without my permission. She confronted me, upset about the things I wrote, and since then, things have been tense. I tried explaining that journaling is a private way for me to process emotions, not necessarily a reflection of what I’d say directly to her or anyone else. But she doesn’t seem to understand and is still hurt.

Now I’m questioning whether I should continue this friendship or let it go. I feel really overwhelmed, confused, and guilty—even though I also feel like my privacy was violated.

Have any of you been through something similar? How did you handle it? Is this something you can come back from?

Thanks for reading and any thoughts you might share.

TL;DR:
27F here. My friend (27F) read my private journal without permission, got upset about things I wrote while venting about the friendship, and now things feel broken. I’m not sure if I should try to fix it or let it go.",0,1l4mzmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l4mzmn/struggling_with_a_friend_who_read_my_journal/
Shy (17M) around GF (17M) Parents and Mom frustrated,"
So this past weekend, my girlfriends (feels weird to say it) invited me to her house. I thought it was going to be a casual hang out between me and her. But the casual hang out turned into a more eventful evening with her turned into 4 hours of constant conversation with her family. 

Her and I are not the most talkative with people we don’t really know. I have only really met her parents a dozen times and they are just usually very quick interactions. 

This time, we were all together and the mother was the one primarily talking. She made a remark at the that evening calling me « very quiet » and I didn’t think much of it. It’s true that I can be quiet, especially when I am forced to talk with people 3x my age. 

But 2 days later, I found out that it was actually the mom lowkey expressing her frustration that I wasn’t talking enough and putting effort to talk. But, her mom really does like me and approves of my character. 

I feel mad at myself for not talking enough which I wasn’t. I was making the occasional comment and awkward laughs. But I am also upset that comment was made to me considering the situation I was put in. I wasn’t even expecting to come to her house expecting a 4 hour dinner disguised as an a behavioral interview. 

TL;DR GF’s mom called me quiet and not putting enough effort in conversation for a 4 hour dinner that I didn’t even know was a parent meeting.

How can I [22F] tell my bf [22M] I’m upset that he’s not spending enough time with me without making it seem like I’m trying to limit his time with friendship,"I’ve been with my bf for about a year. Recently my needs aren’t being met and I’m not sure how to tell him. I fear that it’ll come off like I’m sour about him hanging out with friends or just constantly complaining. 

Context:
 I (22F) kind of have a nightly routine. It’s pretty simple; after I get off work I’ll call my boyfriend (22M) and we’ll chat on the phone until I fall asleep. We’re a bit long distance so we call to keep in touch. Recently, I’ve been feeling like our conversations were pretty stale so I suggested instead of talking every day we talk to three days out of the week. My boyfriend agreed and we started doing that for a little bit and it helped a bit. Along with that I’ve been feeling kind of left out, especially when were both with a group of friends. I often feel like I fall to the sidelines. What usually happens is, my boyfriend will talk a lot with all of the other people in the group and I kind of drift to the back. I’m not really good at inserting myself in a conversations especially when it’s a topic I don’t understand or know anything about. I also feel like it would be rude if I jumped in. So I end up in the background and feeling like a secondhand character. I’ve expressed this to him many times, but he never really grasped it fully. I brung it up again after this past situation (which I’ll get into) and he now sees where I’m coming from. He’s expressed that he’ll do more to include me in conversation and has apologized for not understanding me before. 

The problem:
So now for the real issue. Recently, my boyfriend made a new friend. And he was super excited about it and really wanted me to meet them. So of course I was pretty excited to meet them. The time came and I ended up falling behind while my boyfriend his new friend pretty much hung out with everyone else in the group. (This was before I brought up that I felt left out) Everybody in the group was super excited to get to know them so I never got a chance to actually have a one on one with the new friend. It wasn’t anyone’s fault. Everyone was super excited to have a new person in the group. I just didn’t know how to insert myself into the conversations and fell behind. But ever since then I haven’t had much chance to talk with my boyfriend. Him and the new friend are getting along really well so they’ve been hanging out a lot. So I’ve had less time to actually talk with my boyfriend on the phone. When I get off work, I check his location to see if he’s home because that’s how I know he’s available to talk. But every time I check his location he’s either at school or at the new friends house. I don’t like to call him if he’s at school or at a friends because I know he won’t have the time to sit and have a conversation bc he’ll be too occupied. This wouldn’t be much of an issue if he wasn’t at the friends place all day and night. By the time he gets home I’m fast asleep. So for the past week, my routine has been off, no calls at all which sucks bc I like to fall asleep in the phone. So this entire week we haven’t had a chance to call at all. It’s really frustrating, my routine is off and I’m also not spending any time with him. But I also don’t want to pull him away from his friends or make it a big deal since I’ve already complained about being a side character. I feel like I’m overreacting because I know nothings intentional. How do I tell him that I’m upset about not getting to talk with him without coming off like a bitter gf? 

TLDR: My bf has been hanging out with his new friend all week so we haven’t talked much. I’m upset about it bc I’m used to talking with him at-least 3 times a week and that’s been completely shattered. I wanna tell him I’m upset about it but don’t know how to without coming off bitter. How should I approach this?

How do I 20[F] confront my bestfriend 20[F]?,"Should I confront my bestfriend that I'm very tired of her negativity?
Here's a little context on the situation: 
We've been friends since day-1 of college, met her at the campus itself. She's very a sweet and genuine person, and I cherish the memories we've created together. 

But, there're things that have really started to get on my mind now, so much so that I need to get these thoughts out of my mind. 

She's a bit of a negative person. She didn't much friends during her school time, especially interactions with 'guys'. So she seems to be a bit scared to talk to new people and confront them. I'm fine with that, but I feel it is a bit overboard, she tends to change her path in college not to interact with anybody, run away when she finds people that might come and say hi, finds it weird to go and start conversations. Now this affects me to cause when she runs away from people, it kinda takes away my opportunity to interact with them as well as I'm supposed to stay with her since we're good friends. 

She's always been a really top student during her school life which kinda dropped down when she came to college. Now her not having any experience with getting low marks, makes her absolutely depressed seeing others scoring more and her less. I'm kinda fine with that too, but then this doesn't just apply to marks but other achievements too. 
Anybody else getting an internship at a really good place? BOOM. Starts to find flaws and ways to bring them down and discuss with me. Anyone gets a new boyfriend? BOOM. ""Now even this person has a boyfriend, what am I supposed to do, I'm just a failure"" comes crying to me.
One time the teacher graded us with a 6 marks difference on a group presentation we did together, she called the teacher 5 times to change her marks and how was I graded more, almost cried and even made me almost talk to the teacher to increase her marks. 

There's this another girl in our college who likes to post about her life on social media. Any little hangout she goes for, she tends to post pictures and videos of it on her insta and honestly, the photos are indeed quite aesthetic. Now, my friend always ends up criticizing her on how she's posts so much about so many little things like why she gotta post pictures of buildings and parks what's the point blah blah.. which does not make any sense to me like it's her account let her be? And it's not just about this one girl. I've seen and heard her criticise many others. 

Another thing, she loves to laugh on my face. Anytime I do anything wrong or say something wrong, especially if we're discussing about studies. She just loves to laugh on my face about it. I'd never do that to her and I never have. She loves to rub my embarassing moments on my face. I lost my front teeth when I fell down a few days back, and it has made me extremely insecure about my smile and my face so much so that I avoided talking to people without a mask for a few days in the beginning in my college. She'd find moments where I take off ny mask just to laugh and click photos of my face. AND IT'S NOT JUST MY TEETH. It has been like this about every little thing 

She thinks too much, too negatively about so many things, is always very very very embarrassed to try out new things or talk to new people and finds it 'cringe'. And I feel like I've compromised a lot on my experiences just so that she feels comfortable. I couldn't really make much friends other than her during my 3 years because I was always pretty much with her and she hates to be alone. She wouldn't go to college on days I wouldn't go. Say things like how are you going to cope with the things being taught in classes whenever I didn't feel like going to classes due to my Post Graduation admission exams because she was missing hers too and wanted me to come. 

It's not like I haven't tried to express my feelings about all of this to her, though I'm sure I haven't been clear about them, but whenever I'd try to talk about my feelings, she would start to bring me down and make it about me. She'll cry, call me a bad friend, say that oh this is just some miscommunication that happened between us I didn't mean that, etc etc. 

I'm tired of this. I love her, I really do. But I really feel she's too insensitive about other people's things especially when she starts to cry about every little grievance in her life. Also, needs to give less  attention to 'what other people would think'.
I've never really confronted her about this straight forwardly. Should I confront her? 
What do I say?  

TL;DR: 
My best friend is constantly negative, avoids people, and brings others down when she feels insecure — including me. I’ve sacrificed a lot to stay close to her, but I’m emotionally drained. Should I confront her, and how do I do it without it turning into drama?

Do I (21F) let my husband (22M) go after 8 years of being together?,"I will make this very short and straightforward. We met as kids (13/14) and it was puppy love. Fast forward to us being 17/18-18/19 we got pregnant. He cheated on me physically and emotionally while I was pregnant 3yrs ago(not counting his multiple micro cheatings for years before), I cheated on him twice after that. First time was just physical so I could get it out of my system and disconnect myself from him as we had only had sex with each other before he cheated and the second time was just emotional (last time was about 2yrs ago). We both decided to let it go, forgive, and work on us. But he can’t seem to do it and I guess I’m wondering should I just give up? I do want to be with him and work it out but even after all of it I can’t seem to let him go. Right now he’s unsure if he wants to continue this but I know what I want and it’s my family but obviously I can’t force him. So do I just call it quits or should I wait and see what he decides? Feel free to shit on us in the replies, I know it’s a wack situation but I know I want to forgive and stay together. I just don’t know if I want to or should wait for him anymore.

Am I [28M] staying with my gf [27F] for the wrong reasons?,"I'd like to preface this by saying I \[28M\] love my gf \[27F\] and this relationship of 2.5 years has been the happiest one I've ever been in, but also the saddest one. It truly fluctuates. However, the saddest moments have become more and more frequent and we've recently run in to a lot of problems recently and we almost broke up (me leaving). 

There's a ton of things that I love about her, so many things that I never knew I'd want in a partner but now realized I do, but there's a few things that I don't like either. For example, she's pretty anxious and insecure, gets jealous easily over nothing, is a bit on the controlling side (nothing too insane but def the gf that's asked for the most 'changes' in myself). However, the one thing I always feel from her towards me is love. More than I've ever felt in my life. If I say I need to talk she's available in a heartbeat. If I say I miss her she'll literally run over (it's like a 20 min walk between our houses). If I get sick she comes over and takes care of me without a care that she'll get sick too (I do the same ofc, but she has gotten sick like 2 times). I also know that she finds me incredibly attractive, like she literally bites her lip sometimes when she's staring at me and I can visibly see her eyeing me up and down like she wants to eat me, even if I've just woken up with drool all over me. These are all amazing things and things that I love, but again, she has those jealous, insecure, controlling bits that pop up pretty frequently that's making things so difficult for me.

For example, I'm a pretty stand up guy, like I try to respect my partner and I'm definitely not a 'bad boy'. I'm a nerd that enjoys going to the gym so I ended up building a good body and with lucky genetics I have decent looks. So one thing she's always told is how she doesn't want me interacting much with random females in the sense of like if they come up to me at the gym, just act pretty dry, etc. If someone seems over eager or overfly friendly, shut them down. No solo hangouts with random women unless they're a very close friend, etc. She had an ex who used to msg tons of women on the side and do weird things so I understood it from her point of view and it's not like I talk to women anyways so I played along. 

Recently, a guy at work had apparently mentioned to her that he had a free guest pass to this gym and asked if she wanted to go with him and the two went together and exercised, played some games, etc. This kind of bothered me because first off I'm a gym bro and she has gone to the gym with me 2x over our entire relationship, but also she's told me all these things about saying no to women but some random guy from work who I've never met or even know of ask her to go to the gym and she sees no issues. That felt a bit hypocritical to me.

I know she didn't do it in a weird way, she explained she just wanted to check out the gym and didn't think anything of it and I believe that she had no ill intentions, but I asked her straight up if she'd be upset if I did that and she said ""yeah probably"", so it just feels like double standards.

This is just one very small very recent example, but she has other tendencies like asking me to rate women that appear on TV and get kind of upset if I find them attractive, etc.

So little things like that definitely makes me think twice about this relationship, but again the love I feel from her is more than I've ever felt. Like idk if it's normal, but I've never felt this loved with any of my exes. I guess the question is, am I staying for the wrong reasons? Like I'm so terrified that I'll never be loved like this again. I have full faith that she'd stick with me through thick and thin and take care of me and all that which is honestly all I want in a partner. At the same time though, we've been trying to fix these issues for so long but nothing is really changing, and I'm tired of us going through like 3 months of the best time of my life followed by 1 month of insane sadness while going back and forth. What should I do?

  
TLDR: I love my girlfriend, and our relationship has been the happiest and saddest I've ever experienced. We've been together for 2.5 years, but recently, we've faced frequent issues, including her anxiety, insecurity, jealousy, and controlling tendencies. She shows me an immense amount of love, more than I've ever felt, but some of her behaviors, like telling me to avoid talking to other women or being upset when I find others attractive, feel like double standards. She's had past trust issues, which I understand, but it's causing tension. I’m wondering if I’m staying for the wrong reasons because I’m afraid I’ll never find love like this again, but we’ve been trying to fix things for so long without progress. What should I do?",6,1l4hulh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l4hulh/am_i_28m_staying_with_my_gf_27f_for_the_wrong/
I (26F) have a higher libido than my (27M) partner and I'm scared it will ruin our relationship," My partner and I have been dating about 6 months. I really love him and we get along so well. The only problem is it feels like he doesn't care if we ever have sex again. I am always initiating it. Sometimes he does get into it but it just makes me feel like a predator kind of. We never had that hot and heavy honeymoon period. Both him and I are often hurt or sick due to outside factors but even in those times where neither of us are, it usually doesn't lead anywhere too sexy. I'm not saying that we never have sex but we definitely don't do it super often. I worry because I don't want having sex with me to feel like a chore. It is also very hard to make him cum and I'm not going to lie it makes me feel so bad about myself. I've never been in this situation, I've only had men use me for sex pretty much so to find one who basically doesn't care is so strange and truly fucking me up a little bit. I didn't even think I had that high of a libido until I met him. I just like him a lot and I know he likes me too but the bedroom more often than not lets me down. I'm honestly just scared that he really doesn't like me deep down, is gay, or has a porn addiction so bad he's not willing to admit it to me because he would rather jerk off than sleep with me. I feel like a teenager. I just feel so insecure. I didn't think sex would be that big of a deal for me but it really is I guess. I don't know if I can stay with him if this doesn't get any better. I want a boyfriend, not just a friend.

Trying to repair marriage to my disconnected and defensive spouse [30NB] after I [29F] went back to school.,"My spouse and I met in college about ten years ago. We started out as friends and stayed that way for quite a while, mostly because I was working through the aftermath of a series of unhealthy relationships. Things started to shift once I began addressing my mental health, and eventually, we began dating—about seven years ago. We got married five years back. Like most couples, we've had our share of disagreements over the years, but overall, we've been a supportive, loving, and healthy partnership.

Lately, though, something feels different.

Three years ago, I made the decision to go back to school part-time to pursue a master’s degree, while continuing to work full-time. It was a big commitment, and before enrolling, my spouse and I had several conversations about what it would mean for our day-to-day life. We don't have kids or pets but an apartment still needs cleaned and food still needs cooking. They agreed to take on the brunt of the household responsibilities so I could focus on school and build toward the next step in my teaching career. I still took care of groceries, laundry, bills, and help clean on weekends, since they work too. We still carved out time for each other when we could, though not as much as we would have liked.

Over time I noticed a shift in how we communicate. When I try to talk about things that are bothering me, my spouse gets defensive. For example, if I say something like, “I feel like you don’t want me to kiss you right now,” after they pull away, they’ll roll their eyes and respond, “that’s not true,” then shut down or get curt. Like I am making it up. But it's my feeling so how could I make that up? And if I bring up something they’ve done that hurt my feelings, I usually get a quick, “Well, you do it too,” and the conversation ends there. Even when I try to express something positive like telling them I enjoy certain affectionate moments and want more of that kind of connection, it’s met with a sigh or an uninterested “okay,” like they’re already tired of the topic. It doesn't feel like they care a lot of the time.

I’ve also tried to explain that I’d appreciate more romantic gestures instead of things feeling mostly physical or sexually driven, but even when they’re being kind, it often feels like there’s an expectation attached. Like the affection isn’t coming from a place of emotional closeness. We do have a physical relationship but I would say it is focused on their pleasure more than mine. Or they will be romantic for a week and then it goes back to things being normal with no consistency or follow through on the needs and desires I express.

The hardest part is that I no longer feel like I can talk to my spouse about my emotions or needs. It feels like I’m walking on eggshells, unsure how they’ll react or whether they’ll listen. I don’t know if this disconnect is because we drifted apart during my time in grad school but I’ve tried so hard to show them how much I value the life we’ve built together. I wanted them to feel seen and appreciated for the support they gave me.

I feel uneasy around my spouse. I’m not happy, and I don’t know how to fix it. I want to approach this in a way that gives our marriage a real chance—something thoughtful, healthy, and honest. Now that I've graduated I would like to rekindle our spark. How do I open this conversation in a way that won't activate their reactiveness?

  
**tl;dr: Had a great relationship for seven years. Now, feeling disconnected from spouse after going back to school while we both worked. Spouse seems disconnected, acts defensive, and deflects. Tried my best to manage during school, but now I've graduated. How can I talk to them about our marriage in a way that won't cause more of a rift?**",3,1l4gzkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l4gzkw/trying_to_repair_marriage_to_my_disconnected_and/
"My (25M) bf  (21M) told me that I don’t know how to love someone, help.","Throwaway cause my bf knows my Reddit. 

So I (25M) and my bf (21M) have been together now for 6 months. Let’s call him Jay. We’ve had a pretty steady relationship and are soon to move in together in 2 months (not finalized). There is one glaring issue that keeps coming up and that is our communication styles. Jay keeps saying that I am very direct in my communication and that he struggles to communicate his feelings with me because he’s more passive. However I don’t really pick up on his passive hints, and it usually turns into an argument of me not picking up on hints that he says he gave me on how he was feeling and his calls for emotional connection. 

I’m unsure on how to understand his communication due to how nuanced and very particular it is, whereas I am direct while not being blunt. Recently we had a blowup due to him being very apathetic when telling me that we wouldn’t see each other much due to a new schedule change with his company. Since he was apathetic and very stoic, I answered him with solutions and told him that we would work through it and still be able to talk and meet up. However, Jay got very upset, saying that his apathy was actually a call for me to be vulnerable with him and say that I would miss him rather than give solutions. I apologized but I told Jay that I didn’t understand how that would make sense. We talked and later he said that I was someone who he could not love someone properly due to my inability to understand his emotional cues (beware that the whole conversation was over text since I was at my parents house for the weekend). 

I’m at a loss because we couldn’t find a middle ground as Jay was adamant that I fix my ability to understand his emotional cues. I don’t think I can because yes I can learn his habits, small ticks, repeated behaviors and make associations but I think what he wants is me to read his mind. Jay has tried becoming more direct in his communication but says that he feels exhausted having to prompt my reactions. I love him with everything I am. I just don’t know how to fix this. 

I just wanna know how I can become more aware of emotional cues? 

TL:DR; My bf and I have different communication styles and it has become the one trigger to almost all of our arguments. ",5,1l4gjeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l4gjeh/my_25m_bf_21m_told_me_that_i_dont_know_how_to/
34f just married 34m,"TL;DR Okay, here's a shortened version
Weve been friends since the early 2000s. When his dad got sick and almost passed during COVID, I helped out because I worked in the medical field, even though I lived in another state. We fell in love, and he'd pay for me to visit. In 2024, I moved close to him. I'm a very sexual person and used to lots of intimacy, which he knows from my past. 

We got married in May and moved in together, but things changed. I want sex all the time, but he's not as sexual and says I can be ""a bit much."" He used to joke and call me Little Caesars you know (hot and ready). For instance we've only had sex twice in the last 10 days. I suggested days and time frames just trying to be considerate. I have toys, but it's not the same, especially because the sex is amazing. I'm gaining weight and feeling irritable. I asked him if I was the issue maybe something about me changed because it feels like as soon as I put this ring on he stopped offering dick. I don't know what to do.",0,1l4f2c5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l4f2c5/34f_just_married_34m/
Should I (21F) tell my boyfriend (20M) about this situation?,"I really don’t know what to do and i don’t know where else to post this so.. here goes nothing. 
I have this friend we’ll call P, everything had been fine between us every time we hung out…
But yesterday he was at my house & all of a sudden he started getting aggressive, like punching me (my side & arm. i have bruises) i told him to stop but he said “oh im not even doing it that hard”. and after that he just kept doing stuff that made me extremely uncomfortable, like touching me, hugging me, forcing me to “cuddle” with him, wanting me to kiss him, even after i kept shoving him off etc. 
Mind you i am small, im 5’1 and probably 90lbs & this guy is probably 130lbs & 5’10, i was genuinely struggling so hard pushing him off. 
It was a back and forth of that for a while because he would not leave no matter what i said, but finally i got him in my car so i could take him home, i got to his house, and he tried forcing me to kiss him like grabbing my head hard and i shoved his head back as hard as i could and told him GET OUT. 
Anyways, basically, i really really don’t know if i should tell my boyfriend about this or not.. this situation with P brought up a lot of stuff in the past so now i just feel super uncomfortable thinking about anything intimate or whatever and i’m scared this will affect my relationship, oh and him & i have been together 8 months. also especially because my boyfriend already has trust issues from past relationships and certain insecurities and i don’t want him to be upset with me… even tho none of what happened was my fault at all.

My girlfriend of 10 months wants to say good bye to her ex. We have been dating for 10 months, live together, and have a child on the way. He dated her for 2 years and was a piece of shit. Not abusive by any means but not the best partner. She broke it off with him and became friends with him for several years after that. Upon meeting me she told him it was serious and focused on us. She called him several days after my birthday on his birthday to wish him well. That ended in him yelling at her and she didnt tell me this until she told me she wanted to say goodbye. I shut down the idea twice and the third time i told her im setting the boundary that she cannot contact him Now that she is pregnant she wants to tell him that and say goodbye, because he is entering the secret service and may die in the secret service. After setting the boundary she told me she would respect the boundary but is not okay with it. Am i in the wrong here? What do i do if she contacts him anyway? I feel like there is an emetional connection heren especially in telling a past partner that she is pregant with our child. What do i do here? Any advice?

And then we had another argument about it and then she agreed but ut was more of a guilt trip so I denyed to do it like that

I (21M) Scared my (20F) Girlfriend Is Going to Leave me,"So, for some context she stayed at her friend’s house for 4 days, and she barely texted me. She called once, and I’m a very anxious person. But I gave her space so she could just be with her friend.

The day she got home, we called and I accused her of talking to her ex. I just couldn’t help myself; I’d been checking what she was doing, and I saw someone with the same name on her friend’s list. All the anxiety I’d been holding in just came out, and that’s when I accused her. After that, she was visibly upset and didn’t want to talk to me.

She texted me saying that she needs to think about all of this, about whether she even wants to be with me, and that we’re going on a break. I haven’t seen her for 3 weeks (most of that time I had COVID), and I was supposed to see her today, but then this happened.

I sent her a message tonight basically saying that I started boxing. I took my first class today to help divert my anxiety towards something healthier, so it’s not all on her (which is unfair). It worked. I had no anxious thoughts towards her. But now I’m just scared she’s going to leave me. She read the message but left me on read. I’m trying to respect her space and leave her alone, but I keep having these massive urges to message her because I miss her so much.

We’ve argued like this before, probably three times, and I know I caused all of them. But this time I’m actually doing something about it. The one time I’m actually trying to fix it, it feels like everything is going to end.

I don’t know what to do.

**TL;DR:**  
I accused my girlfriend of talking to her ex out of anxiety. She’s upset and wants a break. I’m trying to give her space and started boxing to manage my anxiety. She left my message on read, and I miss her but I’m scared she’ll leave me.

"BF relates every story back to himself, makes me feel unheard and unsupported. Need advice.","My (35F) bf's (36m) chattiness and vulnerability are something I LOVE about him and want in a partner. However, we've been together been 6 months and, despite my efforts (and I have made pointed efforts) I have had difficulty finding room in the relationship for me to share, including about my lifelong battle with depression. Recently went through a hard time and I was spinning out--I needed emotional support from my him and was pretty devastated when he made it entirely about himself. His heart was in the right place, but he has the tendency to a) try to relate, which turns into a long story about him b) give advice, which turns into a long story about his own experience or c) try to comfort with hyperbolic compliments, which end up feeling like a denial of my whole flawed self and my pain (especially given I haven't been able to share enough to show him my dark shit) and it just makes me feel like he isn't seeing me at all. After giving myself time to cool off, I had a talk with him about it. I talked about my depression. He listened. I explained how his patterns prevent me from sharing my whole self. I explained that when I'm talking, especially about painful stuff, I want to feel seen, understood, and affirmed before we go into relating stories. He took all of that in and he tried to put it into practice during that conversation, but he had trouble. And I had trouble giving specific examples of things he could say or do, it seemed intuitive to me. So I need advice: what are some practical phrases or questions you or your partner use that make one another feel heard, and to comfort when sad? Anyone ever been or been with a ""relater"" who changed/improved their style of listening?

NOTE - No mean comments, please. I love this man, he cares deeply, and he does in fact listen and remember what I say...he just doesn't say the right things when I'm feeling sad, and he's willing to work on it. Looking for practical advice in that regard. 

TLDR - Bf's listening-style is to try to relate by telling his own stories, and it makes me feel alone. He wants to work on it. What are some simple phrases or practices that you or your partner use during active listening to help foster deep connection and a sense of comfort and support?

"I 19M found out my girlfriend 20F of 2 years, was watching porn behind my back and I need some advice.","For some context first me and her set boundaries with porn and masturbating we both said it was fine but just let the other person know or communicate it if the other person asks about it, and one time in her room I just got the feeling she was I don’t know why I just get feelings about things and they are usually right like intuition so I asked her I came off very calm and collected and said it’s fine if she is I just would like to know she said she is not and that’s only my job. 

So I was on my girlfriends phone about 2 weeks later, I was gonna search something on there I don’t remember what all I know if my phone wasn’t on me and hers was right there I open google and her account had some notifications up by her account picture I clicked it to see it was just alerts about anime stuff and legos but I saw the search history button I know I shouldn’t have clicked it but I was just curious as I was scrolling I saw her searching up a porn site reasonably frequently and I was shocked and felt honestly kind of cheated, I cross referenced the dates and realized most the time she would was around the points of our arguments or fights which around January and February of this year was quite frequent it was a small rough patch but I mean it was the same time as me and her texting each other arguing and I remember randomly she would go quiet and leave me on delivered and right under one of the times just before searching the site she looked up if I can see if she read the message if she long holds the notification and obviously that’s a no then 1 minute later she searches it up. I was reasonably hurt by this one time she did that we were on a call and she was watching it behind my back. 

After she came back from the bathroom she asked what I was doing and I very calmly asked about what I had found and she immediately lied and said she has no idea how it got there or why it was there finally she admits she did look it up but not why and just a whole bunch of lies and random excuses followed after this. 

I waited weeks saying I understood why she was scared but i communicated I was very hurt and just want to talk about it and all she has done in those weeks is lie about it I didn’t go too far in her search history at that point, but recently I did and found out it was over almost every argument she would do this purposely behind my back to be horrible to me. I’m just very hurt and upset if this was a different situation I would be fine but to do this just out of pettiness is insane to me. What I’m asking for is help on how to handle this I don’t know what to do, do I break up with her, do I try and talk more about it? I’m lost and need help or advice.

I’m supposed to do all the cleaning and pay for a majority of things like food and household items. I’m currently doing CNA classes from 8am to 4pm, and he has 8 hour shifts at work.

When we see each other he wants to have sex, do what he needs to do and turns on the tv and basically ignores me until I fall asleep or go do something else. This hurts, and I just tried talking to him about it and he said “well you could cuddle me too” just deflecting his behavior. Can anyone give me advice or insight on how to communicate with him in a way he will receive it? It’s making me feel worthless.

the man (27M) I'm dating tells me that he loves me(25F). I don't love him. Should I quit it or wait?,"I(F25) have accidentally found myself in a relationship over the last six months. A friend and work colleague(M27) of mine expressed interest in me, which I didn't reject at first as I appreciate him in many ways and even find him attractive, which is very rare (I don't find 99% of people attractive, but I'm not asexual). But I also said from the beginning that it takes me an extremely long time to fall in love with someone (only happened once in my life) and that I don't want a relationship per se because I'm struggling with personal issues right now. He suggested that I take things slowly and basically got me used to being in a relationship. To the public appearance, the constant contact, the planned life together, the physical touch. I kept protesting because I had the feeling that he was deciding every step of the relationship on his own, without my involvement. He tried to do things differently, but never followed through. He was in love and wanted me to be too.

Apart from that, he's a great person. I've never had such a deep emotional connection with someone. I also have a social phobia and therefore don't have many friends or people who aren't uncomfortable to talk to. But it could just be platonic on my part.

I also find him physically attractive, which is so rare, but when he kisses me it's just fine with me and to him I'm the love of his life. Now he's started telling me all the time that he loves me. And as far as I've been able to go along with everything so far, I just can't say it back because it's not true. Should I just wait and see if it comes? Should I tell him that he shouldn't say it?

To be clear: many people would simply stop dating at this point. My problem is that in my entire life so far, with one exception, I would never have allowed anyone to kiss me, for example, because I obviously have a problem with attraction\*. And I'm afraid of losing this rare chance at love. Furthermore, he treats me extremely well except for this one thing. And I have made his life better in every way, I don't want him to have no one to look out for him. And I don't want to lose the one person I can share my thoughts with. And the chance to love someone. I don't want to lose all that.

\* I've also been to 3 therapists who found no trauma in it and just assume that I'm like this

How do I (19F) act with my father (60M) from now on ?,"I (19F) posted in another sub about my father asking me to marry a cousin (33M). Since then the cousin deleted his message and my father did like nothing happened. I have passed my last exam, even if I were so low.

I have been trying to limit talk and contact since then. But today he asked me about my result and wanted to  celebrate the fact I have validated my school year. I didn't refuse. He also pointed out that I only give him short answers. I lied that it wasn't the case and doesn't respond when he asked if I was still angry at him. I made sure to tell him I will not spend the vacations with the rest of the family and i sadly accepted.

I know that the people who answered in my other post advised me to cut all contact with him. For the moment he still didn't cut me off financially and I started to look for work and find other ways to stop depending on him. But I couldn't bring myself to do this entirely. I feel ashamed. And there are my siblings at home who are still minor. I don't want to bring them to this mess.

I know I should cut contact, but I just can't do it. I also fear there will confrontation at home.

I can tell he really cares for me, but there are certain significant flaws that I have noticed throughout our relationship (however, nobody is perfect - not even me). I recently brought him to meet my family a couple of months ago, and my parents had some thoughts. They were a little afraid to tell me, but thought that I should know, and called me recently to explain all of their opinions:

1. He didn't say ""please"" or ""thank you"" very often, and often his responses sounded like commands. For example, my dad asked him if he wanted anything to drink; he just said ""water"", and that was it. No ""sure, water, please"", or anything. More significantly, he joined my family for a nice dinner because my brother got a new job, and we wanted to celebrate. However, when the dinner ended, and my family paid, he didn't say ""thank you"" to my parents.
2. At the dinner, the waiter was clearing the plates, and he wanted the waiter to also clear his water glass. She told him that the meal wasn't done yet, so he should keep it. But he just said a curt, ""Oh...just take it."" My family and I were both a little shocked at his reaction, because he could have said it nicer, like ""Oh, that's fine, I'm finished with everything.""
3. Whenever he would leave the house, he would just exit the house, and not say ""goodbye"" to anyone. Plus, when my best friend came to visit, he didn't even bother to say good bye to her when she left - he told my brother to tell her goodbye for him.
4. He didn't offer to help cook or wash the dishes, or do any household chores - he just sat on the couch the whole time working (he works as a consultant and is pretty busy), and left his dirty dishes in the sink. Of course, even if he offered, my family would never actually ask him to help, that is customary of being a host. But, it kind of irks me that he didn't even bother to ask.
5. My mom sent him some photos that she took of all of us at an event we all went to, and he never replied. Not even a simple thumbs up for heart reaction. He did mention the photos in passing once, but it wasn't a ""thank you for the photos"". This was kind of strange, because he usually does reply her.
6. I always have to remember to remind him to do certain things, like buy a small gift when coming to meet my parents, or sending them a message during holidays/birthdays. When I met his parents, I did not come empty-handed. He ALMOST did, if it weren't for my paranoid-ass double checking with him the day before.

There were some other points, but I don't want to bog down this post with the smaller details that perhaps my parents were being too nit-picky about (they are VERY traditional immigrants). To clarify, I myself did see some of these habits while I was at home with him, and I tried to explain to him that he should be more generous (?) and polite. He did end up improving on some of the points I made above, but I think there was just too much to point out, much of which is pretty common knowledge. **My question is, is it worth it to try to help him learn and grow these habits?** It seems like he simply just never learned basic manners/habits from his parents. Even my parents said that he seems like a really sweet and caring guy, and he clearly has no bad intentions, but etiquette like this is pretty basic knowledge and they were surprised that he didn't exemplify any of them. In terms of our relationship, I'm not sure if this is something I want to end the relationship over, but could definitely be swayed. There are other pressing issues that would influence me.

i [28f] am giving birth soon and want my mom [55F] to visit but my stepdad [60M] won't let her. Any advice?,"Without going into too many details, I'm estranged from my stepdad \[60M\] and no longer speak to him. I'm polite at family gatherings, but that's it. He's deeply narcissistic, controlling, and emotionally volatile. My stepbrother is also estranged from him (independently, we didn't decide to do this together) so I'm not the only one who holds this opinion of him. I absolutely do not want my stepdad around my child \[0F?? for automods\] and my husband \[29M\] does not either.

In the past, my stepdad has prevented my mom from visiting me. I had recently broken off an engagement and he refused to let my mom come visit me because he was afraid I would try to break them up. She said she was caught between ""a rock and a hard place"" and that he's forcing her to pick ""between her daughter and her marriage"". Unfortunately she picked the marriage :( 

Yes, I know it's abusive and it sucks but there's nothing I can do about it since she won't help herself. I try to be open and loving toward her and let her know I can take care of her if she ever wants to leave.

I'd like my mom to visit me, bond with her granddaughter, and help out with some postpartum care. She's also interested but says my stepdad will want to come to, which I absolutely don't want, and she says she's unable to come without him. Anyone have advice for how to approach this and, as a bare minimum first step, get her to at least be able to visit me?

Roommate has been shutting me out since I got back together with my boyfriend — feeling lost and unsure how to move forward,"I (23F) live with a roommate (23F) I will call her A, and a second roommate (23F) I will call her B. We moved to a new city and in together after we graduated college and had gotten extremely close throughout our senior year. I started dating Jack (23M) right before we moved in: August 2024. Our relationship hit a rough patch early this year, and we briefly broke up. He has since started getting treatment for mental health issues, and we’ve been working through things and are back together.

The night he broke up with me, we had all been drinking. He came over to my friend's house and broke up with me. Afterwards, A texted Jack begging him to come back to the house so that they could talk (she witnessed him breaking up with me). He basically told her no because he thought she would yell at him (she has always been super protective of me) and he said some hurtful things to her in response to her not taking no for an answer.

During the time we were apart, A and B both came to me and explained that they thought he had been controlling during our relationship. I started going back to therapy after the breakup and was very open with my therapist about our relationship and our conversations. My therapist and I decided that this was not a toxic relationship or one that I needed to leave.

After lots of talking and working through the obstacles in our relationship we got back together. Both A and B had told me that although they wished I wouldn't get back together with him because they think I deserve better, they would support me either way. He spent the night at our apartment and B was home, so I let her know he was coming over. The next day A was very upset with me and I did not know why. I went to her room to ask why and she told me it was nothing and to leave her alone in a dismissive tone. For the next week she would not look me in the eye or acknowledge my existence. After I tried to talk about it in person and was dismissed I tried to give her space.

I ended up texting her about it because I thought maybe it was too hard to talk about in person. She told me that she was extremely upset that I told B before I told her that we got back together. She also wanted space from me and said that I betrayed her and only talked to her when I needed her (we had been best friends for over a year at this point and I shared a lot with her, she shared a lot with me, and I was there for her through a huge heartbreak and lots of cries). It hurt my feelings that she wrote our friendship off as me just taking advantage of her when in reality we both have always been there for each other and had a very meaningful friendship (she always said this to me and constantly thanked me for being the best friend she's ever had).

I respected her wishes and gave her space. After about a month of not talking I reached out again and asked her if she wanted me to move out. She told me I was crazy for even suggesting that and blamed me for not talking to her and ""ignoring her"". I explained that I tried to give her the space that she asked for and was waiting for her to let me know when she was ready. The conversation ended on good terms but there wasn't really a resolution. She promised me multiple times that the rift between us had nothing to do with Jack and was just about me being a bad friend. I apologized again and tried to fix it. He had also apologized to her by this point twice and she forgave him and apologized to him as well. 

Over the last few months, I have been trying to talk to A while still giving her space. Every time I made an attempt she would either dismiss me, mumble something under her breath, or some days she would be the sweetest, kindest, friend that I had been missing. Her boyfriend stays with us often so a lot of the conversations I had with her he was also there for. He has always been nice to me and likewise. I started asking her to go on walks alone with me during my lunch breaks when I was working from home and she always accepted. Every time I thought things were getting better I would hear from someone else that she had been saying something negative about me or Jack.

The final straw was when my old roommate came to visit and A told her that I was in a controlling and toxic relationship, ruined all of my friendships for him, was male-centered, only talked to her when her boyfriend was around, and that she wished that the two of them were friends instead of her and I. It has been very hard to hear these things from someone who used to know me better than anyone else in this world. I know in my gut that I am not male centered. Yes, I have a boyfriend, but I also have other friends, lots of hobbies, and constantly do things on my own without him. I also have talked to her plenty of times without her boyfriend there and I have never been closer with him than simple small talk.

I have tried to leave B out of all of this because I know she is in an uncomfortable position. I miss my friendship with her, she recently said the same thing and that she wants to talk about it, but I'm worried about trying to explain how I've felt without making her feel like she needs to pick a side.

I guess I am just trying to find out if I am overreacting for wanting to move out, I will have to break the lease and find a subleaser in a city that I can barely afford to live alone in, but I feel like it is my only option at this point. It has now been over 4 months of mostly silence (and her sometimes making me feel like it's close to being repaired just to dismiss me the next day).

Since I heard about the conversation she had with my old roommate I just feel so lost, lonely, confused, and like maybe I made up this entire thing or that maybe it is all my fault. Some days I feel like I'm going crazy and others I feel like I tried my best and need to just give up on any hope of A and I being friends again. Any insight, opinions, or advice would be really really appreciated.

**TL;DR:** I (23F) live with two roommates, A and B. I dated someone who broke up with me, then we got back together after therapy and working through issues. Roommate A got upset with me for telling B before her about the reunion and has since been distant, sometimes kind, sometimes cold. I’m struggling with whether to move out despite the financial strain because the friendship feels broken. Looking for advice on how to handle this situation.",0,1l3ludk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l3ludk/roommate_has_been_shutting_me_out_since_i_got/
How should I (24M) get my girlfriend (24F) to communicate her feelings?,"Me and my girlfriend have been together for 4 years. Yesterday my gf wanted to post some pitcure of us on instagram, after an hour of constantly asking me about how she should edit every little detail, she did but then immidiately deleted it after i told her i think she should bring the saturation down a little. Then she just broke down in tears. I wasnt sure whats wrong because up to this moment we were having a great day and she was in a great mood too. Wouldnt tell me anything and then went to bed early. I felt like she's mad at me but decided not to press further to give her space. She talked to me normally but  like in a way thay made it seem that she'd rather be anywhere else or something. Today she comes home from work and even tho she is talking to me like nothing happened I can feel her hyper negative energy. She just tells me she's been feeling bad and that's it. Doesn't want to tell me the reason or anything. In the evening I finally asked her if she's mad at me or if I did something wrong because I don't understand what and I'd like to know. She tells me I got it all wrong and she's not mad at me at all but feels like I just don't believe her. I tell her it sure seems like she is and it's making me feel like shit because I have no clue what's going on and she's so negative I started feeling depressed. Then she goes on to tell me that her mom asked her if we had a fight a bunch of times because she didn't believe her that we didn't and how she's so annoyed her mom bothered her with those stupid questions. I tell her she asked because that's exactly what it looks like and that I'd really like her to communicate when she feels bad and to tell me why so I can be there for her or help in some way, but to not just create this hostile environment without explanation making everyone around her feel bad too because she's not feeling good. She just ignored that and it was like she didn't want to hear it. This happened in the past but I thought after some years and talking about it she learnt to communicate and regulate her emotions but I was clearly wrong. It just feels so immature to me and kinnda emotionally manipulative. I can't read her mind and I don't think everyone should feel horrible just because she's having a bad day (she was rude to her parents that day too). I always make sure to not make it everyone's problem when I'm sad or going through something and communicate with her how I feel. This is draining me so much and I don't know if I'm an asshole or not. 

TL;DR My girlfriend's refusal of communication about her emotions is emotionally draining me

My (25F) mom (52F) has a bad gut feeling about my boyfriend (29M),"My (25F) mom (52F) has been having panic attacks, nightmares, and a bad gut feeling about my 3 month long-distance boyfriend and I and thinks something very bad will happen to me next time I go to visit him. She is making me scared and upset, what should I do?

So, I had my first date with this guy 3 months ago and we've been dating ever since. We met on a dating app in November and he lives in Canada, but I live in America. He was living only 40 minutes from me right across the border, but then before we got to meet he got transferred at work 4 1/2 ish hours away, so I thought that was it and we wouldn't date, but then he would occasionally text me to ask how I am and everything and in late January we started actually talking again. With our first date being March 1st. We had another date a month after because we now live so far from each other and are long distance. I am from a city in America that is only an hour from where he was living so I have gone home to visit my parents and then went from there to Canada both times. He now got moved again to another Canadian city another hour away (so about 5 hours from where I live). We text everyday and we always send each other cute reels and messages and always talk to get to know each other and stuff and we have really fallen for each other. He genuinely treats me so well and is a great boyfriend.

My mom just called me and she was freaking out and told me she just had a major panic attack and she had been having panic attacks and nightmares (and a bad gut feeling) about my boyfriend and I and she's worried that if I go to Canada something extremely bad will happen to me. She told me that everytime I've gone, it's gotten worse. I was planning to go this weekend and so it freaked me out a lot that she just had a very bad panic attack about it close to me going. (I also never told her I was going this weekend). She told me that every time this happened to her (the panic attacks and nightmares plus bad gut feelings) something bad has happened, like her friend had a miscarriage very late in her pregnancy. Also, every time she got in her old car before she had an accident where it completely shut off when she braked and I guess some other things, she didn't say specifically. So now she thinks something very bad will happen to me the next time I go to Canada whether it's me getting into a bad car accident or dying or maybe he does something to me (she thinks). Part of her freak out is because he is from another country (a country that is not Canada) and he is only there on a visa, he gets moved around a lot, and because I have not yet met his roommates or anything. I also have not told many people about him yet as much as I want to because I'm worried about what they will say since my mom's reaction when I told her wasn't great. She is normally happy for me even if she isn't too happy about things involving the guy (I have dated and gone on dates with people in America who are here with visas and she never freaked out about them) She told me she had to call me and tell me all this because she can't let anything happen to me. She wonders why we would even want to be together because of the situation we are in (long-distance and different country origins), but I feel like borders and such shouldn't stand in the way of our feelings for each other even if someone personally wouldn't go though that, I think he is worth it and he thinks I am worth it. I love my mom of course, but she is scaring me and I don't know what to do. I also love and trust him and we would love to have a future together. Also, idk if this would be relevant, but she can track my location at all times (and I have hers too) I don't care that she does, but this is the original reason I told her before others, so she wouldn't freak out to see me randomly in Canada. She has made me very scared, nervous, and anxious because I trust her gut and whenever anyone has a bad gut feeling I feel like you should listen to it because it usually is accurate (unfortunately). I feel very upset that my mom is going through this, but I also don't think it's fair to have to break up over a gut feeling. I immediately told my boyfriend about this and he was sad that she is having bad feelings about us. Please help, what should I do!

boyfriend being distant,"so me (18f) have been dating my bf (18m) for almost a year now (anniversary in 2 weeks). everything was going so great the first months,, I would get love letters, gifts, flowers, endless of compliments and paragraphs. all the sweet stuff. he was so kind and gentle with me and we would spend so much time together. every picture I took, he would hype me up like im the most beautiful girl. when i would need reassurance he would give it to me and would go on how much he loves me. he planned dates and would come over even if simply needed a hug from a bad day. he would call me the swcond he got off work or any time he could. now it’s like im just there. I’ve felt him being distant but it’s not like he doesn’t tell me he loves me or cares for me. it’s just the small things are adding up and im realizing them. he doesn’t update me as much when goinh out with friends, he only calls me when i ask,, he walks in front of me now so we rarely hold hands in public,, he doesn’t compliment me other than the “you looked good today”. sometimes he doesn’t even kiss me until i say something or I initiate it. yhe love letters bave stopped and flowers are rare. when he comes over hes on his phone or when we’re eating hes on his phone. it feels like hes uninterested in our conversations? I don’t want to call him a bad boyfriend because he is so sweet when he wants to be. im a very emotional girl and I have been tjrough some difficult relationships so am I overthinking everything? I cry a lot and he always comforts me when I do,, and he still takes me on dates sometimes and it’s fun but i have this achy feeling that something is different. I know he’s not cheating as he never hides his phone from me (my Face ID is on his phone so I legit have access to it plus I snooped bc I got paranoid and ik that’s bad and I felt bad for doing it but there wasn’t a single thing on there) and he shares his location with me. his mom also loves me and his home all of the time so there’s no way there. my family adores him and he’s the first guy they’ve met,, and im his first girlfriend too. i love him very much and I always ran away at the firsy sign of imperfection in a relationship but I’m trying to stay and work with this because it’s so different with him. am I crazy? I’ve talked to him a bit about how I feel but I don’t want to come across as a bad girlfriend who complains all the time. am I being a dumb teenager ? He talks about our future together like I don’t gwt it. I feel neglected but loved at the same time. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to break up and I truly believe he still loves me. Any advice would be good please. PS. we haven’t had sex in about 8 ish months mainly bc of me (paranoid of pregnancy!) But we have been intimate in other ways! I always satisfy his needs but I don’t know if the lack of actual intimacy is the issue?

How do I (24F) tell my sister (29F) that she shouldn't bring her boyfriend to my graduation based on everything she told me?,"I'm going to have my graduation ceremony two days from now. My sister is the most important person in my life, so I obviously want her there. But not her boyfriend. They have been together for about 1,5 years, and she has expressed to me on multiple occasions that she just doesn't feel the relationship and is considering breaking up. She actually already did one time but kind of got pressured into giving it another chance. Her boyfriend and their mutual friend persuaded her. The last time we saw each other, about two weeks ago, she seemed really sure she wanted to break up. Even more so because her boyfriend said stuff like ""There are scenarios in which it's okay to hit a woman, for example, if they cheat on you"". Then went on to tell my sister ""don't do anything bad to me if you don't want me to hurt you"".

I immediately expressed that this feels like an unsafe situation and I begged her to end things for her own sake. They live together at her own place, so the guy would need to move out (he has somewhere to go). I get it, it's really not that simple to break up, especially if you live together.

Today, she asked me what I thought of her bringing her boyfriend to my graduation. I've never met the guy, so this would be our first time meeting. I just don't understand. She's miserable in this relationship. She's been wanting to break up for a long time. According to her, she basically doesn't feel anything for him, they don't even really have good times together anymore and says they should've stayed broken up. And after his comments about hitting women, I don't understand why she's acting like that did not happen. Am I blind to this? Could something physical have happened and I'm just missing it? Is that why she's acting like everything's fine?

I'm scared that if I tell her not to bring her boyfriend, then he is going to ask why he cannot come, and she'll confess that she'd told me stuff about him and I fear that he may escalate the situation into physical abuse.

What I also don't understand is, if they're gonna break up, why bring him to a family member's event? Am I missing something here? Please help me navigate the situation. I don't wanna push her away by talking shit about her boyfriend. Even if she doesn't like him, I know this can be counterproductive.

I also wanna say I don't wanna sound selfish. I understand the title is about me and my graduation, but let's forget about that, I'm actually more worried about her. It's alarming for me how miserable she feels in this relationship but stays in it anyway.

TL;DR Sister wants to bring her boyfriend to my graduation but he said pro-abuse stuff. She's told me about wanting to break up multiple times but still decided to invite her bf

My partner is allowed to have bad days but I’m not.,"Title makes it sound worse than it is. My boyfriend (24M) and I (22F) have been dating for only about 10 months. He struggles with depression and has for a very long time, way before we met. I knew this going into the relationship and wasn’t expecting to ‘fix him’ or anything. The challenge pt. 1 is that he often has hard days, like really really hard days. Never threatens anything drastic but will completely shut down and shut me out. I will only hear from him again (besides a text back here and there if I text him first) after a few days when he is ready for my support. This has happened enough times (about one week every month) that I know the drill and it doesn’t really affect me anymore. I know that when he’s ready he’ll reach out and will be able to ask for what he needs to feel better and I will be there for him at the drop of a hat. Until then I’ll just do my own thing and try not to crowd him. The challenge pt. 2 is that it’s not very often that I have a hard day. I’m pretty good at self-regulating my emotions and managing them on my own (several years of therapy later). However I’ve had an incredibly stressful last month or so. My dad had an intense medical emergency that’s only just calmed down a bit a few days ago, I’m in the middle of moving across town while simultaneously searching for people to take over my current living situation, I am trying to get myself back into school so I have a ton of stuff I need to do to get enrolled in university, work, friends, life in general, etc. I will admit when I’m overly stressed and overwhelmed I can sometimes become quite a downer, I know this, this is why I will usually just put myself in time out in the corner until I’m regulated again. Boyfriend wants to be supportive and I appreciate that. He invited me over for dinner last night and asked me to open up about my stress, so I did. And then he asked me to leave. Because my emotions made him feel worse. So now I’ve shared with him how I’m feeling and it has shifted to him now being sad and feeling helpless and “needing some space”. In his defense I can be very stubborn about not wanting to feel better when I feel overwhelmed, but it’s the classic thing of ‘I don’t want you to try to fix this. I know it will be okay. I just wanted to tell you how I’m feeling’. I left at like 11 pm because “my being there was making him feel worse.” This feels pretty classic in our relationship and certainly is not the first time this has happened. Safe to say I feel super frustrated and went to bed questioning our relationship. It just kind of feels like he made my bad day about him? Maybe that’s a selfish take but it’s just not surprising to me that it went down that way. Maybe I should actually be posting this in AITAH? but I guess i just don’t know what to do? Do I just assume that my boyfriend is not the person I go to for emotional support?? Or just cut my losses as I’m young and we haven’t been dating for super long and end the relationship? Not sure if I’m being irrational.

HBF is currently single. He is divorced with no kids. Its been years since his divorce. HBF is very close to our kids, particularly our oldest son because they bond over football stuff as HBF played football in college and son looks up to him. 

Select out of character behavior:
1. Had a family beach day. I needed to reapply sunscreen to my back, which I'm usually able to do on my own, but he saw me and volunteered to help and said I got you. I told him no thanks I got it. He insisted and said let me help, and I semi yelled at him with no I'm good really. My husband was not paying attention and in his sun daze.

2. Family dinner out.  H went to the bathroom, HBF who had several drinks in his system told me that I looked particularly hot tonight. My kids were right there. I was so embarrassed and reacted with what bro which is something I would never say, but felt the need to react with something guy'sh. He laughed and said bro?

3. Over for dinner, randomly asked, with my H present,  if he could see old clips from my ballet performances. H reacts with WTF?  HBF who is super into lifting and gym stuff as a hobby said he wanted to see what a female ballet dancer's physique looks like at peak performance. H cracked some joke and laughed and asked if he could share the clips he had on his phone. I said yeah ok, trying not to overthink it or make a fuss about it.

4. HBF will pick up our son from practice sometimes because his work schedule is flexible. Yesterday, when he dropped him off at my studio, he came in which he never does. I was still teaching. He said hi and before leaving he rubbed my back and held my shoulder and said let me know how I can help out more with the kids. They are the highlight of my day. This was all in front of my son who is a teen. I did not appreciate his physical touch at all. I reacted with why have you been acting so weird lately and he just laughed it off and said what do you mean? I didn't have time to talk as I was in the middle of teaching and just told him nvm.

TL;DR: HBF has as of recent engaged in subtle behaviors which make me feel uncomfortable, as if he is suddenly romantically interested in me. H whose mind is very occupied with work seems completely oblivious. No life changing event for HBF to trigger this behavior. Do I talk to H or ignore the issue? Is it even an issue?

My (F 20) former hook up buddy (M 24) keeps reaching out to me while he’s in a new relationship. Why- and do I tell the girl?,"So this guy and I used to be coworkers. He was basically my team leader. I worked there for 3 years, and the second year of me working there he suddenly started flirting with me, asking me to go on dates, and hanging out. Eventually, we did go on a date or two. After that we had a sexual relationship, I think because he realized he didn’t want to be in an actual relationship with me. I used to be in love with him, although I now think that that was mainly a trauma bond in disguise, so I kind of stuck with him. After dating for a year, we had a sexual relationship for two years. Now, a little more than a month ago, he was texting me and asking me when he could come over, telling me he missed me, etc. Three days later, I saw that he had removed me from his private story. I was confused, and decided to tell him that I knew when I’d be home alone, just so I could see his reaction. Mind you, this was THREE days after him being so affectionate. Suddenly, he replied that he was dating someone new and wanted to be honest... My instincts were right. I reacted calmly, and I was expecting us not to have any contact. I removed him from my private story, didn’t text him or send him any snaps; nothing. Mainly because I didn’t want to be complicit to an unfair situation towards the girl he’s dating with. But to my surprise, he had re-added me to his private story 2 days after telling me, and now keeps texting me every now and then, asking me how my studies are going (we both study medicine, he just finished). It’s the exact same sort of useless dull question every time. The convos aren’t sexual and don’t have a flirting undertone, but they just feel very… unnecessary? I figured that maybe he wasn’t that serious with her, until I saw on WhatsApp that he changed his profile picture to a picture with her. He also removed other people who I know he was dating/seeing, which makes me even more confused, because why the hell are you trying to stay in contact with ME, when our relationship was solely sexual. I.e; we never met up without doing anything sexual, and I don’t think I offer him anything that his girlfriend/friends can’t offer. I know for a fact he didn’t care about me beyond how I was fulfilling his sexual desires, because otherwise he would’ve treated me differently. I’m totally confused why he keeps reaching out, but my main question is, do I have a responsibility in informing his supposed girlfriend of this, even though the convos aren’t sexual or flirty? I don’t want to open a can of drama, but I’m not sure what’s right.. I just know I definitely would not like my boyfriend doing this if I were her. 

TL;DR: Had a 2-3 year sexual relationship with a former coworke. A month ago he was still affectionate, then suddenly said he was dating someone new. I backed off, but he keeps messaging me casually. Now I’m confused why he still reaches out and whether I should tell his girlfriend, even though it’s not flirty.",3,1l3cf6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l3cf6p/my_f_20_former_hook_up_buddy_m_24_keeps_reaching/
I’m [24f] feeling selfish for wanting my bf [24M] to listen to me. Is this worth ending an otherwise safe relationship over?,"I’ve been with my boyfriend for 5 years. We love each other deeply, and he’s a genuinely good person — kind, generous, funny, adored by my family, and he talks about marriage often. On paper, everything is solid.

But lately, I feel emotionally invisible. He rarely asks about my interests or how I’m doing. When I try to talk about things that matter to me, I feel like I have to water myself down just to keep his attention. I’m naturally expressive, but I’ve learned to stay quiet around him because he seems to tune out when I talk about anything deeper than surface-level stuff. It’s making me feel really alone.

I’ve also grown a lot — emotionally, mentally, and professionally — and he just hasn’t. It feels like I’m dating a version of him that never really matured. When I’ve tried to bring this up, he says he’ll try harder, but I don’t think he really understands what I need. I don’t feel truly known, and I’m starting to think he might never be capable of that kind of connection.

What’s making this harder is that I’m starting to develop feelings for someone else — someone who actually listens, notices when I’m not okay, and shares more emotional depth. I haven’t cheated, and I wouldn’t, but I feel so ashamed for even wanting something more.

My boyfriend hasn’t done anything “wrong,” but I don’t feel like an equal or a whole person in this relationship anymore. I feel selfish for wanting to leave someone so good, but also scared that I’ll regret staying and spend my life wondering “what if.” 

TL;DR: I love my long-term boyfriend, but I don’t feel emotionally connected or seen anymore. I’ve tried talking to him, but nothing’s changed, and now I’m developing feelings for someone who does make me feel understood. I feel selfish and ashamed. Has anyone else been here? How do you know when it’s time to leave a “good” relationship that just doesn’t feel right?

Edit: part of me wonders if this is just what happens in a long term relationship? That fresh feeling fades and the curiosity ends… I’m sure even if I date again it will happen as time goes on.

How can I (19F) help my friend (19F) too see that she's in a abusive relationship and he (21M) doesn't love her?,"For a little back story, I (19F) have 2 friends (18&19F) and we we're a trio for 4 years. Almost one year ago 19F met a boy at a volunteering in a festival and he started to like her. She wasn't interested in him at first because he wasn't her type but somehow they got together.

She wanted some summer fun and didn't actually liked him and always talked to us about how to talk to him into breakup. After one mouth of them dating she started to ignor us, made excuses to not see us and her and 18F has a big fight over 19F lying that her uncle died when they supposed to meet up and posted a story with 21M. Since then me and 18F remained friends.

We fought with both of them over small things like her saying that we weren't there for her for 3 months (the time we fought after her lie and didn't make up for 3m) and somehow we went back to being friends (after we apologised..idk for what).But that didn't last long, more precisely for one day because he made her think that we wanted to breakup them up.

He followed me to my high school and shouted at me curses and tried to hit me with his car for being friends with her. Somehow after a few months we we're again friends and she told us what she was going throw with him and how she was abused physically, mentally and he even cheated her with multiple girls on his other phone.Then she cut contact again. How can we help her?

Desperate for advice on what to do with my coworker,"I (26F) am currently in a relationship but I have a great close friendship with a guy I work with (27M). He’s become one of my best friends but I’ve noticed I’ve caught feelings for him and he told me that the feeling was mutual. I deeply care and love this guy but I knew the relationship was becoming too intense (ie started texting all the time, spending all of our time together at work) and I knew I really had intense feelings for him. As of yesterday I had to stop talking to him for the sake of my relationship with my boyfriend. I love my boyfriend deeply and I would never ever think to cheat on him however I knew I felt deeply emotionally invested in my coworker and I knew it was getting inappropriate. Anyway it goes without saying that work has been horrible. He is upset as am I and it’s so awful being at work at the moment. I find myself wanting to talk to him all the time and it’s like I’ve lost my best friend. We work quite literally together in the same room all day so my heart is aching over him constantly. I feel like I’m grieving him and my head is in tatters. I want to take work off to get my head together but I wonder if I should do this and also what is the best way to navigate this?

Tl;dr: me and my male coworker are best friends but have realised we have caught feelings for each other, but since I’m taken I’ve had to give myself space and now working with him is torture.

"[UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?","I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.

An obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I ""realized my mistake."" When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.

I'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.

I've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.

I've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.

>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself. 

**TL;DR:** Left my husband, happier than ever.

**EDIT**: I'm surprised but happy this found so many people! I genuinely thought I was going to bookend this story and have it disappear into the ether. But whatever urge I had to write it, and whatever brought you to reading it... who knows? Maybe it was meant to.

I (20F) rushed into a relationship with my best friend (21M) and now I’m overwhelmed with insecurity,"I’m really confused about my feelings right now. I (20F) have known my boyfriend (21M) for two years, and we were really close friends for the last eight months. Less than a month ago, we got into a relationship (my first and his second).

At first it felt right. We got along so well, and he’s been nothing but sweet and supportive. But now that we’re actually together, I can’t shake this feeling that I might’ve said yes too soon. We had a fight before we started dating where he thought I didn’t like him romantically, and I was scared of losing him. I think I agreed to the relationship out of fear more than being fully ready or certain.

He’s doing so well. He says I motivate him, and he’s been pushing himself, improving, really doing great things. Meanwhile, I feel stuck. I’ve just been avoiding my own problems, not putting in effort, and I hate it. Not because he’s doing well, that’s amazing, but because I feel insecure in comparison. Like I’m not even good at the one thing he believed I was good at. I keep worrying that one day he’ll realize I’m not enough and leave me behind.

I’ve noticed myself pulling away even though everything seems fine on the outside. He’s totally in love with me, honestly head over heels, and here I am questioning everything. I don’t even know if I’m really in love yet, or if I just didn’t want to lose him as a friend.

To top it off, my end semester exams are around the corner and I can’t even focus. Academics were the one area I used to feel confident in, and now I feel like I’m falling apart there too. I know I'm the problem here not him, I don't really feel like worrying him since he is busy.....

I don’t know what to do or how to with all these feelings. Has anyone else felt like this after jumping into a relationship? Is this a normal feeling after being together for less than 3 weeks or a sign I need to step back?

TL;DR:
Started dating my close friend (21M) 3 weeks ago. He’s amazing and clearly loves me, but I’m feeling unsure and distant. I might’ve said yes out of fear of losing him, not love. I feel stuck, insecure, and can’t focus on anything, including exams. Is this normal early relationship anxiety or a sign I rushed in?",1,1l34t99,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l34t99/i_20f_rushed_into_a_relationship_with_my_best/
Anxious 8 months into relationship (F23) (M25) How do I proceed?,"I've(23F) been together with my boyfriend(25M) for about 8 months now. We have a really stable relationship, I love him dearly and can really see how he could be my soulmate. He’s kind, funny, a good listener, always takes care of me and makes me feel very loved and seen. We have the same interests, humor and he’s already the person I feel I can be the best and most genuine version of myself around. 

There’s just one problem - I've never had the “butterflies” around him and I haven’t really been obsessed in the sense I believe most people are in the honeymoon phase. Even though I've thought about him a lot, fantasized about him, looked at pictures of him before going to sleep and even started to cry multiple times because I've felt so touched by how lovely of a person he is - I couldn’t really escape the feeling that something maybe was missing because of the lack of butterflies or having to catch my breath by the sight of him.

Around a month ago this concern developed into anxiety. I believe it to be a mix of the concern regarding the butterflies and the fact that we'd been together for awhile and it all started to feel more serious, more everyday-like. I don’t feel the need to reach out to him all the time anymore, my libido isn’t as high and I can sometimes experience a feeling of boredom when we’re together. Every time I catch myself feeling a negative feeling around him I become anxious - which has also led me to, to some extent, connect him to feelings of anxiety. What’s maybe also worth mentioning is that I always experience a sense of emptyness during summer.

However, right now I can’t escape the feeling of hopelessness. I love him and I can’t imagine being without him, but the future all of a sudden feels scary. I'm scared of being unhappy, but the only one I want to be happy with is him. How can I get over these feelings and start enjoying my relationship with my wonderful boyfriend again?

"Did I [22M] mess up my realtipnship with my gf [22F], because i wanted more intimacy?","
Hello there. I have a problem. I [22M] an my girlfriend [22F] have been together for almost half a year. It's the first relationship for both of us. We came together in dezember last year. But after 2 Months she started to distance herself phisically an there was almost no more intimacy. I didn't know why, but also I didn't ask her. So last week, I told her, I would wish for a little bit more initimacy. It was a little wierd, but I thought it went well. She told me, she just wasn't ready yet. And I was okay with that. But a day after that she wanted to talk to me again. She said, she started to distance herself physically for a while now. In the evening I wanted to clarify this situation and talk with her on the phone, to which she annoyedly agreed. So we talked about it and came to the conclussion, that we both need to talk about our Emotions and speek to each other, if we have a problem. Also, she is a very active talker, but im very social awkward and not really good al talking or expressing my feelings. She wanted me to talk more about myself, so she doesn't has to talk all the time. I understood  her feelings, an want to try my best in the future. But even so, I am still not sure, if we really safed our relationship. She's visiting her parents for a week, and I am scared, that she will brake up with me, when she comes back. The conversation just doesn't felt finished.
Or am I just overthinking? Can you guys help me out?

TL;DR- I talked to my girlfriend about more intimacy and now I'm scared, that she will brake up with me.

Caught her in a really weird lie. Should I cut it off to avoid a toxic relationship?,"I ( M23 ) had been seeing a girl ( F22 ) for three weeks. On this past saturday, I was showing someone pictures of her from her posts on instagram. Later that day, at 11 pm I went back to her instagram feed, and her posts were gone! They were posted under a section with an exclusive viewing list, so she had removed me from it.

I didn’t really think much of it but today I went to hang out with her earlier and I casually brought it up. She instantly started denying that she’d removed me and kept denying it and said “i hadn’t even posted on my story, why would there be anything to hide.” I didn’t even mention stories. I didn’t even know that the exclusive list for posts was the same as the close friends list for stories. Then she opened her close friends list to show me that I was still on it. When she searched up my name, she very quickly tapped it to add me to it. I clearly saw this action and told her I wasn’t stupid. She continued insisting after that that she had never removed me. After that, I very neutrally said I had to go, I smiled, gave her a kiss and left. It is 10 pm and for an hour after I left she kept texting me random little unrelated details, as seen in the image I attached. This to me indicates guilt behavior, right?

Is this a break-offable offense? What the hell is even going on here? Why lie so weirdly and obviously like that? I don’t care that she’s posting things she doesn’t want me to see necessarily, I’ve known her for not long. That’s not the issue, it’s the lying and denying and gaslighting that rubbed me really the wrong way. Keep in mind I don’t know her insanely well yet, I’ve only been seeing her for 3 weeks. What should I do?

TL;DR, she lied to me incessantly about removing me from her story one night and I have no idea what she posted. Both that and the lying rubbed me very much the wrong way.

My 26m 3 year relationship 28f says she feels pressured to have sex but doesn’t allow me to be non sexual either is a paradox,"


Hey r/relationships, I'm struggling and could use some outside perspective. My girlfriend 28 and I 26m have been together for almost 3 years, and things have felt off for a while, especially around intimacy.
She recently told me that she feels pressured to have sex when we hang out, wants to just relax and lay down, and thinks I ""don't enjoy that."" 

Now, I hear her and I want her to feel safe and comfortable. I would never ever pressure or want to make her feel pressured. The thing is, I've been trying so hard to do exactly what she's asking for. I constantly invite her to hang out non-sexually—just to chill, watch a movie, go for a walk, grab food, anything low-key. But she almost always declines. We used to spend so much time together, and now it feels like she actively avoids it.
This leaves me in a really confusing and painful spot. She says she wants non-sexual intimacy, but then rejects my attempts to provide it. Meanwhile, our sexual intimacy has plummeted. She used to be so  into sex with me, but now it's maybe once every two weeks, if that, and it feels like the opposite of how she used to be. This frequency isn't fair to my needs in a relationship. This is turning into a looping paradox. I of course want to have sex with her, but  want her to want that too. She says that “
She still does” but her actions show very much otherwise. 

I've tried talking about it, but it often circles back to her feeling pressured or me ""making her feel bad."" I've even brought up if she's holding onto any resentment from the past (I never cheated or anything, just maybe didn't always meet all her needs perfectly at earlier points) and told her it's important she be honest if that's the case yet she says not at all. But I still feel like she's not acknowledging my efforts or how her constant rejection (both sexual and non-sexual) makes me feel. I feel unwanted, confused, and like she just doesn't care about spending time with me anymore, in any capacity. She makes me feel bad for wanting sex, but then I offer non sexual hangouts ( which I enjoy a lot too ) and she doesn’t really want that either, it’s a cycle of this which she says she feels pressured, blames it on not having non sexual hanging out, doesn’t allow us to have those non sexual hang outs, then it continues into a spiral. 
It's an almost 3-year relationship, and I love her, but I can't keep feeling this way. Is this just a fundamental incompatibility? How do I even approach this when it feels like she's rejecting all forms of connection, despite her own stated needs? Do we just break up?
Thanks 


TLDR; gf says she feels pressured to have sex when we hangout, but I always try to hangout non sexually, she doesn’t want that either, weeks go by without sex and it creates a spiral of feeling bad ",4,1l2wzbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2wzbv/my_26m_3_year_relationship_28f_says_she_feels/
"Overbearing Mother, need advice","Posting because I just had a fight with my mother and I don't know what to do next.

Tl;dr Overbearing mother overstayed her welcome, fought with husband, stressing my pregnant self out until I erupted and asked her to leave. Afraid my relationship with her is finsihed.

I apologize in advance for the long post. I have a lot to get off my chest.

Some background. 
I'm 29, married (2 years), and expecting my first child this fall. My mother, 60, lives in the next state over, still married to my dad, and this is her first grandchild. I'm convinced she's bipolar and she has insane mood swings just hours apart or a comment can set her off. She also lost her mom 2 years before she had me and has been telling me how she wants to be here for my pregnancy because she didn't have her mom during hers.

Also, about me, I am afraid of confrontation and I hate arguments. I always try to find a peaceful solution before any arguments happens so to avoid them. I am also struggling with prental depression. Also, my husband, 32, works nights.

Pre-stressor to Fight
Ever since I got married, my mom has been on to me about sending money to my husband for various things (mostly gas and groceries). I do earn more than him and while I do not earn enough for us to live on one income, I have enough left over after bills so I can afford to send him money. I still have my bank account linked to my mom's so she can see all my transactions and such. I know I need to get my own separate account but I'm afraid she will take offense and yell at me for ""not being financially responsible"". This whole thing has led her to think my husband is ""leeching off"" of me and is a ""lazy bum"", which is not true. He pays his share of bills and I only send him money if he absolutely needs it.

The Fight
About a week ago, my parents showed up out of the blue, no warning, to our new apartment. They said they came to help us move in and get settled. My husband and I appreciated their help, but my husband was upset that they didn't give us a warning and just showed up unannounced. My dad ended up leaving after a few days but my mom said she was staying to finish laundry, cook meals, and such. After 3 days of just my mom, me, and my husband in the 2 bedroom apartment, there is tension. My mom is upset that my husband doesn't ""do any chores and sleeps all day"" (he works night shift so of course he has to sleep during the day). My husband hardly leaves our bedroom for fear of incurring her comments. I was stuck between them, having to listen to them complain about the other (more so of my mom complaining about my husband). 

Two days ago, I came home from work and before I even walked in the door, my mom accosted me saying my husband failed to feed and take the dogs out before he left for a friend's birthday dinner and that he never did the dishes or anything. I told her I just got home and I have no idea about anything. I excused my self to take a shower, cried in the shower, then my husband came home. He assured me he did in fact take the dogs out and feed them, and he wasn't aware the dishwasher needed to be unloaded.

I asked them both to come to the living room so I can talk to them together and proceed to tell them that they need to learn to get along because if it's like this for every birthday, holiday, etc, then I don't want this baby. My mom then starts yelling, saying it's all my husband's fault and that he's the one not listening and he's being lazy. At this point I run sobbing to my bedroom with my husband following me. She enters the room without knocking and tells my husband this is his fault and he's the reason I have prenatal depression (not true). I'm telling her to stop and I finally had enough and screamed at her to leave. My poor husband has been calm and trying to calm me down. She leaves the apartment to I have no idea where.

The next day I receive texts from my dad and paternal grandmother, apologizing for my mom and telling me to forgive her because she's only doing this for the best for me and that she has good intentions. My husband is telling me to give her some space and time and everything will work out.

I feel that my relationship with my mom is closer to being severed which I don't want, but if she tells me to choose between my husband or her, I'm standing by my husband. I know my mom loves me but I'm afraid of how more complicated things will get when the baby arrives because this is my husband's child too. I don't know what to do next and I want to try talking to a therapist but I can't afford it at the moment with the baby coming. Any advice is appreciated.",5,1l2tkfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2tkfn/overbearing_mother_need_advice/
Feel let down by my friends for my birthday,"I (45f) had a big birthday this year, but I also almost died. While I was in the hospital (coma/ICU for 2 weeks, then recovery/rehab for 6 weeks) my mother kept my friends up to date with everything going on (OP walked 100 feet today! etc)

My friends and I (about 6 of us, male and female, ranging from 30-40) have been throwing each other birthday parties for the last 4 years. Sometimes house parties, sometimes dinner. Last year when one of our friends turned 40, we all spent literally thousands of dollars to go to St Martin for a week, complete with a private chef and a private boat/snorkeling tour.

If you do the math, you'll know my last milestone birthday was weeks after lockdown, so kind of a bust. The one before that was literally 2 weeks after my father died. For my birthday the last couple years they've thrown me a surprise party. Great and exciting the first year since I'd never had one, but last year I had made a reservation for all of us at a speakeasy I wanted to check out. Showed up at my friend's house in this amazing black velvet dress ready for a night out, only to find all my friends in jeans enjoying charcuterie. My gift last year was all of them donating money for me to go on a safari (about $250 total - amazing! but it never happened).

This year, my one friend A (35F) took charge in planning my birthday. I sent her a list of restaurants I was interested in, she asked if there was anything I wanted to do before or after dinner. I suggested maybe light snacks in the park and (again) a speakeasy after where our other, less central, friends could join us.

Got all dressed up, showed up at my friend B's house (34F) and...

Jeans and charcuterie. No gifts.

I don't want to sound ungrateful. I have great friends, but like... Do I not even rate a whole meal? I almost fucking died not even 6 months ago. It's a major birthday. 

I know things are tight for people financially right now - a couple of our friends are out of work - but B and her husband just got back from a month in Europe (after their last trip to Europe earlier this year).

I just feel like... Idk. Disappointed? Hurt? These are all people I've tried to do thoughtful things for, I've been friends with all of them for at least 5 years - in fact, I'm the one who introduced them all to each other. Like they were all part of different friend groups and I brought them together.

I just thought this year would be special.

Idk if I should talk to them about it or if I'm just being a brat and should let it go.

TLDR; Had a milestone birthday and a near death experience and my friends dropped the ball on my birthday party.",5,1l2skr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2skr9/feel_let_down_by_my_friends_for_my_birthday/
Can't tell if I can't handle long distance or if I just don't like him anymore,"I (17M) started dating my boyfriend (18M) around a month ago. We're long distance, he lives in the US and I live in Canada, but I don't know if I can do it anymore. I've been in long distance relationships before and I've never felt the way I feel. It just feels so tiring trying to do a long distance relationship. I have multiple friends who live in the US and it doesn't feel tiring keeping up with them or anything but with my boyfriend it does feel tiring. 

I can't tell if I'm just losing feelings or if it's just the distance or both. I feel like i don't wanna talk to him and it feels kind of like a chore to, but every time I think about leaving him I cry. I feel like it's wrong for me to leave this early into a relationship as well. We only started dating early last month.

TL;DR, can't figure out if I (17M) can't handle long distance relationships or if I'm just losing feelings for my boyfriend (18M) or both.",2,1l2rgpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2rgpv/cant_tell_if_i_cant_handle_long_distance_or_if_i/
How do I (f28) gently tell my wife (f30) that I don’t care to hear about her hobby all the time?,"Hi y’all, my wife has an incredibly stressful job and has found it very therapeutic to do creative writing. I love that she has a hobby that she loves and can create something, but it’s become very obsessive. The creative writing is fanfiction for an anime, one that I’ve seen some of but it’s not my style and it’s incredibly overhyped now so I don’t care to finish it. 

The hobby started very small, her just writing for a few hours a month. But recently she’s gotten really motivated to rework a fic that she already completed, and branch out and write a whole universe for it. I adore seeing her passionate about something, but it’s taken over a bit. 

She spends hours at her desk on days off writing, brings a notebook to her work so she can write on her free time, and thinks about it on her way home so when she gets home she immediately has to write down her ideas. She works Monday-Friday, and our weekends were always us going on a date and spending time together since it’s the only time we really get one on one time. But the past 4 weekends she doesn’t want to leave the house because she’s writing, and when I brought it up that I want us to do something, she just kind of brought the mood down while we were out since she clearly didn’t want to do anything but be at home writing. 

I adore her so much, and she’s an amazing partner but she won’t stop talking about her writing. She will ask me to read something or how she can work a scene better, or even questions about the characters since I’ve seen some of the show. And I feel so rude because she’s really passionate about it and is excited about writing, but it’s so much and it’s all she wants to talk about. She came home today and I tried to have a discussion about her grandparents being in town next weekend and how we should prepare (first time for me meeting them, so I’m nervous about it) and she kind of brushed it off and just switched the topic to her writing. 

How do I nicely tell her I don’t care sometimes? I’m worried if I tell her she’s gonna be upset and not talk to me at all about it, which I don’t want her to feel like she can’t be open about her passions with me. 

TL;DR- my wife is obsessive about her writing, and it makes me irritated when she won’t stop talking about it.

"MIL (60F) will not make a plan for her retirement, wife (29F) and I (31M) are afraid she expects to move in with us at some point.","Hello Reddit. I am looking for advice on how to handle this challenging situation. I will start with an overview of our situation and my MIL’s.

My wife (29F) and I (31M) have been together for 5.5 years and married for 2.5. We just relocated across the country for my job but are solidly in our DINK era right now and enjoying it! We are planning to buy a house within the next year and have kids within the next 2-3. 

My wife grew up very very poor and in an equally dysfunctional family unit. Essentially my wife, her brother (31M), her mom / my MIL (60F), as well as her whole extended family (2 uncles and 3 cousins) all lived in the same house with her grandparents. It’s a 3 bed, 1 bath house and if you’ve seen the show shameless, that pretty much perfectly describes their past and current living situation. Her father has been completely absent from her life since she was a baby. My MIL has lived there on and off (mostly on) for over 20 years. Everyone mentioned above STILL lives there full time, with the exception of her grandpa, who passed, and my wife. Nobody, except grandma pays any bills or contributes in any meaningful way. They fight constantly and it’s just overall an extremely toxic situation. 

Everyone who lives there are very poor and is making no plans whatsoever for the future. Grandma owns the house but it is reverse-mortgaged and when she dies, the house will go back to the back. She is in her late 80’s and in good health considering her age, but she won’t live forever. Grandma is retired and living on social security, a pension and the reverse mortgage income. Everyone else there does work, but they are close to or slightly above minimum wage jobs. It is in a HCOL area. 

My wife and I have talked to my MIL a few times in the last year about having a plan for her retirement and we are always met with a shoulder shrug. We have told her that nobody is coming to live with us, although my gut feeling is that she doesn’t really believe us? I am absolutely petrified that when grandma passes and the house goes back to the bank, my MIL (and possibly BIL) are going to show up on our doorstep and expect to live with us for free forever. Let me reiterate that no one in that house makes any plans for the future whatsoever! They have no assets and are essentially broke, so I am not really sure what the best plan is for them besides trying to get into low income housing (which we have suggested in the past, but she has made no moves to look at and apply for). 

My wife does not want her mom to move in with us and I have told my wife that anyone in her family moving in with us is an instant dealbreaker that would end in divorce (I said this before we ever got engaged, and have reiterated my stance on the situation). 

I guess I am asking for any advice on how to navigate this situation, specifically if anyone has been in a similar situation before? Or just any advice on how to handle this and give her mom a wake up call that we won’t just take her and / or any other family members in at any point. Thank you! 

TL;DR: MIL refuses to plan anything for her future, we are afraid she will show up on our doorstep expecting to move in one day!

[31f] my fiance [31m] takes defense over everything and is constantly angry with us,"I'm at my wits end. I love this man with all my heart but at this point I can tell when the evening is going to be shit or not. He hates his job, it's very demanding. So he's usually pretty disgruntled after work.

It's important to add his upbringing. He was in an abusive household. Screaming and hitting was what he dealt with since he was young. He tends to yell often as he says ""that's how he is heard"" as when he was younger that's all he knew.

Example, he got off work and had a bad day. I tried lightening the mood and such and it kind of worked. I picked up sons and brought them home. Where we live is the first time we have all had a house not with my mother, so more space and they're still learning how to clean and stuff.

Son got cereal. Fiance asked what he was doing and I told him eating cereal. He started raising his voice saying ""they need to learn to fucking close boxes of foods everything is fucking open"" so I go out there and explain to son that he needs to close the box. Fiance comes flying in and starts cursing and yelling at him to close shit. I stepped in and trying to be calm showing son how to do it, fiance storms out.

He left and is now texting me claiming I don't have his back and im a ""real piece of work"" and that no one listens to him. I tried to deescalate and tried to explain i did have his back but I didn't want to put the fear of God in sons to do that. I said im choosing to leave the convo as he made the piece of work comment and it was rude.

This happens every few days. He is now offended that I told him how his bad days effect us all and I am willing to help. But now we're going to have another night of him slamming doors and ignoring us if he even comes home.......idk what to do. He doesn't want to talk it out because he gets SO defensive if I say anything negative about his behavior.

Tdlr; fiance screams at us on his bad days and will start being nasty nk matter what I say or do and just gives me the silent treatment until he's over it. We can't talk it out because he immediately gets angry and mean

"I agreed to live with my gf (20F) of 6 months, but now she’s pushing for a $4K NYC apartment and I’m (21M), jobless, and overwhelmed","Before I graduated this May, my gf of 6 months who is an international student from China and I agreed to live together in NYC for her next school year. I agreed but said I'd need a full-time software engineering job first, and if I don't find one right away I'll part-time being a Server or something else to cover rent. She was excited and started apartment hunting right away and imagining our life together.

Now it's June and she's back in China for the summer, and found a corner-view apartment for around 4.2k, which she said is a great deal. Her mom would cover her half of rent, and I'd cover mine, but I don't have a job yet, and no family support. I've been applying 50-100 jobs per day, with some interviews in progress. I told her I'd part-time if needed, but realistically that's hard to balance while improving my skills for job hunting.

When I hesitated, she said the apartment she just found would be gone soon and wanted to immediately sign the lease. I told her I want to live with her but I'm sure... what if I get a job outside NYC? The tech market is bad for entry level rn and I'd take up any job offered. Signing now could mean paying rent without even living there. She got upset and sad I was only thinking of myself and not about where she'd live if we don't get this place. But she does have friends who are willing to live with her.

She said:

“You say you’ve considered me, but your consideration is limited to what *you* think. That’s not really considering me — you’ve put me in a position where everything revolves around you.”

“I feel like I’ve already compromised. My mom is covering the guarantor fee, and I’m helping you job hunt — but you still can’t make this decision. You’re not thinking about me enough.”

She then said we either sign now or she'll live with a friend and rethink our relationship. It it me hard. I realized: it feels like this relationship only survives if we're *not* long-distance and living together. She said if I truly cared, I'd just keep job searching until I find a role in NYC, and reject non-NYC roles. She even said on call, with her family on the background able to hear the convo, ""Never dating a poor guy again."" I told her I'm not poor, my family just doesn't support paying for my rent if we already have a house here, and that I can do whatever I want once I get a job.

I caved in and said I'd work part-time to cover rent while job hunting, and she'd help with apps. But I told her this means I can't afford to treat her to the lifestyle she likes (gifts, nice restaurants, etc) until I get a tech job, since the part-time job will only be enough to cover rent.

I also proposed an alternative: she lives with her friend this year, I stay with my family in NYC, work part-time with fewer hours, and once I get an offer, I'll move-in nearby, renting a cheaper studio so we'd be very close. She said she's ""fine"" with it but said would still be very disappointed in this relationship, saying that I'm not prioritizing on solving the issue by just working more to live with her.

I'll be doing what she wants, but honestly I feel really uneasy. Not just because of pressure, but beacause when things go wrong, she always makes it my fault. I'm starting to feel like I'm sacrificing my own career, stability, and self-worth just to hold things together.

How do I move forward with this without wrecking my career or completely losing myself... I've tried talking to her about this but I may be too narrow in my thinking to convey properly to her, how can I improve our current relationship situation?

edit: The house got signed by someone else, and now she's blaming me for being too slow on making a choice that we ""already decided"" to go forward with. And now, she can't live in her ideal apartment, but I told her I'll help her search, and she said ""good luck finding one that is as good as this one, and just as cheap"".

TL:DR - agreed on co-renting with rich gf but don't have a job yet and she's urging me to part-time to cover rent but I find that hard to balance with job hunting and interview prepping, so she mad.",235,1l2now3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2now3/i_agreed_to_live_with_my_gf_20f_of_6_months_but/
boyfriend (25 M) upset that i’m (24f) “changing everything about myself”,"so today i texted my boyfriend this pic of me with a filter of blonde hair (i am brunette) and was like “would it be bad LOL” and he says yes then goes into how i’m suddenly changing everything about myself and questioning why i need to change and that i’m chasing change. i asked him what he meant and his response was, getting curtain bangs, doing heartless curls 2 nights in a row (helps blend the bangs and i told him that) doing my own nails, taking my lash extensions off, and waxing instead of shaving (just my bikini area) i told him that really the only change I’ve made is the bangs and my lashes because i (1) missed the curtain bangs since I’ve grown out my hair a bunch and (2) the lashes are expensive and a lot of upkeep. I’ve been doing my own nails since December 2024 and waxing or shaving i’m still removing the hair it’s just more convenient for me and we had a whole conversation about waxing, looking into a wax pass, why i’m doing it, etc. before i started going and he had no problem with it then. 

i’m just not really sure how to feel. like i have expressed wanting to do something different with my hair for a while now and my curtain bangs was one thing and i’m not gonna up and get my hair colored tomorrow and he knows that. and i appreciate his opinion and if i was serious about making that kind of change i would like to talk to him about it and hear his thoughts but this was a simple ‘think i could pull off blonde?’ kinda thing. didn’t even say i’m thinking about going blonde, because i’m not it was just a silly little filter i tried. but it quickly turned into why are you doing all of this, you’re changing everything about you, etc. etc. 

i’m not sure if i’m reading to much into this because i was in a previous relationship where my ex partner wouldn’t let me do certain things but also i don’t think it’s fair to say that i’m making all these changes to myself and it seems like there’s some feelings behind his statements he has not brought up to me. 

TLDR: sent my bf a picture of me with a blonde filter asking if i could pull it off and he his response was basically ‘why do you feel the sudden need to change everything about yourself’ when the only thing i’ve really changed is taking off my lash extensions and doing curtain bangs (again) ",4,1l2nolb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2nolb/boyfriend_25_m_upset_that_im_24f_changing/
How do I talk to my husband who never talks back?,"I've (F41) been married to Hubby (M42) for a few years, but we've been a couple well over a decade and friends since the mid 00's. We have three kids (M15, M8, F6) and the last years have been really harsh on us as a family. He has been extremely stressed over economics and such, and I have been working myself into the ground with work, night classes and household chores. We need to go to family therapy, but I can't get him to respond when I suggest it.

The thing is, our house is neuro-spicy to say it nicely. Two kids and me on the autism spectrum, Hubby and one kid on the alphabet-spectrum. Hubby's stress makes him very sensitive to sound and chaos, which as most can guess, our house has plenty of. I have tried for years to get him to learn about low reactive behaviour/low-affective attitude, but he thinks he does it.

He isn't a talker, a lot of his communication is between the lines, and I find him hard to read. I didn't before, when I thought he said what he thought and nothing else. It's confusing for me. When I try to talk about being low-affective with him, he reacts really poorly or just doesn't respond at all.

I have no idea of how to communicate that we really need to go to therapy. My mental health is affecting my physical health, and he doesn't seem to care. I get the sinking feeling he doesn't want to be here with us anymore, but I don't know because he doesn't talk to me. He doesn't respond when I ask. And if I press, he will snarl and walk away.

I need help. How do I talk to him to get through to him? Because I realize that it will have to be me to do the changing if I want something to change.

23M just putting my feelings out on my birthday,"Its my birthday today. I'm a 23M living in the US, and I'm in a LDR with my girlfriend 23F in India. I'm writing this because I just want to put my feelings out.

It gets pretty lonely living abroad. The only person who is very important to me is my girlfriend and I absolutely love her. Every single day I think about her all the time and I just wanna spend some time with her. And especially today being my birthday, I wanted to talk to her for at least 5 minutes. My day is coming to an end in an hour and I'm still waiting for her to call me. I'm waiting so eagerly but I don't think she will.

To be fair, she just started her job today and has a hectic schedule. As much as I am trying to be understanding and supportive, it just hurts so bad somewhere deep inside that I don't get to even hear her voice today. She did apologise for not calling and says she feels bad, and I told her it's fine and I am trying to understand her situation. I even cancelled all weekend plans with my friends so that maybe I'll get to spend at least a minute with her. Due to the circumstances that she grew up with, she is not even expressive and doesn't reciprocate at all. Even through all that, I am changing my personality and trying to be understanding. But idk how long I'll be able to do this. I really don't want to cry on my bday but I'm not able to help it.

I really wish things were different and she was with me right now. I really really love her and I know she loves me too, but I'm scared about so many things regarding our relationship now.

TL;DR
It's my birthday and my girlfriend did not call me. I understand she's busy with work, but somewhere deep inside it hurts me so bad. She doesn't reciprocate and show much love either, so I'm feeling very bad and crying. Idk how to go about our long distance for 4 more years at least. 

Edit: I wrote this post yday when it was my birthday. Today she stayed up late to watch a sports match, and it makes me feel bad that she could've done something similar for me as well. I am trying to be understanding and I understand her position. But because of the fact that she doesn't even know how to reciprocate and express herself, it gets harder for me and hurts more.",0,1l2l39d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2l39d/23m_just_putting_my_feelings_out_on_my_birthday/
My (m/34) new partner (f/28) with adhd talks too much and it's already wearing on me,"Damn it. Long story short - matched with a woman (28) from Hinge in March. We pretty quickly fell for each other. She's attractive, really funny, outgoing, is great at what she does. Early on she told me she has ADHD which was cool. I know plenty of people with ADHD and it hasn't ever been a problem. However, I had this realization that she tends to dominate conversations. Even worse, she tends to check out when it's my turn to speak or takes what I said and brings the conversation back to herself and continues to talk so quickly and for a long time. Sometimes it really does feel she's talking *at* me instead of *with* me. I'm a bit more chill and an introvert but I'm also pretty social so it's not like I need silence always.

It felt like it only happened a few times in the beginning because we weren't spending as much time together. I was also near the end of grad school and working a new exhausting bartending job so I thought I was genuinely just burnt and couldn't keep up with her conversation-wise. There was a day we went out into the city and I brought up something I told her probably two times before but she had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. I got frustrated and I just had to talk to her about it. She was defensive at first but broke down crying on a train and took accountability, which I thought was a good sign.

Things seemed to get better and I see she's been working on it which is great but there's still been other times where the conversation becomes frustrating with her endlessly talking about herself and her stress/gossip/friends. I'm on vacation and I was telling her something personal before I left and all of a sudden she turned the convo on herself and began to cry over what she was talking about, which wasn't related to what I said really. So I got frustrated and kinda been ruminating on this throughout my vacation since I'm alone.

Idk I really care about her but I feel a bit exhausted from her already and it's only been a little over 3 months. I'm feeling a bit silly about this because I used to be highly insecure and jumped into relationships I didn't realize were bad for me and stuck it out. My last relationship being in 2020-2021 in which I was miserable and it ended with me hurting the person. I've spent the last few years really working on myself and truly fell in love with being alone and single over being in a relationship that doesn't work. In other words, I've grown a whole lot over the last two years or so (finally amiright?). I've become more discerning of people and have ended things more responsibly so I really thought my current partner was right for me but I've become less enthusiastic over the last few weeks cause of our conversations and it sucks. I've been trying to be sympathetic to her ADHD but it does get exhausting.

Could it all come down to lack of compatibility? I would love to feel more heard but not hurt her feelings or make it seem like she's shitty, what are some good ways to discuss this with her?

My best friend (29F) is moving across the country soon, and I’ve (28M) been struggling emotionally with the shift. We’ve grown very close over the friendship. Had many deep conversations, plenty of emotional support, and a genuine closeness that felt so unique and special. As her move approached I started feeling very anxious, sad, and a bit abandoned, even though I’m fully supportive of the move and I know that this is what’s best for her.

Over the past few weeks I’ve unintentionally guilt-tripped her over how she’s spending her time left here. I never meant to pressure her, but I now know that I wasn’t being fair or respectful to her autonomy and space. She recently sent me a message saying that she’s been feeling burnt out by the guilt and that the friendship hasn’t felt respectful since she told me the news. She said that she still cares about me and that she just needs to prioritize herself and the relationships that support her right now.

I responded by sincerely apologizing and taking accountability for my actions, expressing that I never meant to hurt her and fully understand if she needs to take space. I told her that I care about her a lot and that I hope we can reconnect in the future when it feels right. She responded that she appreciated the apology, that we’re all good, and that it wasn’t goodbye. She just wanted to be transparent about where she’s at right now.

So currently I’m sitting with the weight of all this. I’m partly relieved that it’s “not goodbye,” but still grieving the closeness we’ve lost. Do you think this friendship can be recovered?

Thanks in advance. This is one of the most meaningful friendships I’ve ever had, and I’m trying to handle this in the most mature and loving way even if the outcome is uncertain.

TL;DR: My best friend is moving, and I unintentionally guilt-tripped her about how she’s spending her time. She said she needs space and the friendship hasn’t felt respectful. I apologized, and she said it’s “not goodbye,” just where she’s at right now. I’m struggling with the shift and not sure how to move forward and recover the friendship.",3,1l2hruf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2hruf/i_28m_may_have_pushed_my_best_friend_29f_away/
"I (18M) have a strained relationship with my parents(49M and 45F) over favouratism between me and my brother (16M), and I don't know if I should confront them.","I (18M) have had a strained relationship with my brother(16M) and parents(49M and 45F) for a while, especially my mother and I have not always had the best relationship. I have long had trouble dealing with favoritism shown to my brother mostly from my mother.  

Thats not the only reasons for our strained relationship, but I won't delve into everything else because that should probably be in another post if I ever choose to make another. 

I had thought for a long time something was wrong with me, and didn't feel welcome at home. I felt like my brother was spoiled, and I always got the blame for everything.  

But I also felt ungrateful, and like it wasn't okay to blame my parents, I had no concrete proof other than the memories and experiences I had, and it's not like I can show them my memories and my side of things. I thought maybe the injustice I felt was just something I imagined, and once again that something was just wrong with me instead, since it wasn't like my life was bad by any means.  

Because of these feelings, and some other life circumstances, I developed major impostor syndrome, severe depression and minor anxiety. 

I have spoken with psychologists about this and sought help and is currently working through my issues. 

I did mention this to my parents' multiple times at a very young age (between the ages of 6 – 12). To be fair the way of asking was probably not the best but I was young and emotionally underdeveloped.  

At the time I asked why my parents loved my brother more than me, which after I have talked with experts, I know it’s the really the wrong question.  

I always got the same answer; they didn't love him more than me, which I don't doubt.  

I admit I probably wasn't easy as a kid, skipping school, fighting, temperamental issues, being friends with some less than good influences and alike. I know now I was acting out, but OfCourse I didn't know that at the time. 

No kids are easy to raise, and my brother had his own issues, and I don't blame my brother. 

Recently I visited my grandmother, and she told me about her abusive mother and her mother's trauma and VERY blatant favoritism. She told me that ever since my brother was born my parents had Favored my brother, and that these feelings I had wasn't totally unfounded.  

She told me how my brother at a young age often threw tantrums when I got praise or other things and he didn't.  

He often hit and screamed when he didn't get something. He often took my stuff and proclaimed it was his, and whenever I told him or my parents this wasn't the case they got mad at me. 

She told me how her and my mother had issues for these reasons because when she had mentioned this unfair behavior and how I always got the blame. When she did my mother always got mad and defensive and said my brother was an angel. 

She told me she wasn't the only one in the family that had mentioned this. 

I OfCourse got mad and didn't know how to feel now that I finally had proof. It wasn't just something I thought, I had actual reason to feel the way I felt. It felt like a missing puzzle piece suddenly just fit, it explained so much of why I have felt the way I felt. 

We talked for a long time about this and all the things she hadn't told me. I was a little mad she hadn't told me earlier, but She told me she didn't want to talk to me about this for a few reasons. 

Shes my grandmother, not my mother. She was afraid this would ruin the relationship between me and my parents further and ruin the relationship between her and my parents. She was also afraid of what I would do with the information, and how I would react since I wasn't an adult. 

Now that I am an adult and because of all the emotional work I have been through she thought that I was ready to know. 

A few clear examples I remember, or she told me about from when i was very young: 

When I was about 4 or 5, me and my brother drew on the newly painted walls to the basement stairs of their house. Which I also have felt bad about and apologized many times for afterwards.  

OfCourse my parents were furious and chose to sit me down on the terrace where they proceeded to yell at me and I wasn't allowed to move until we went home.  

My brother however got no such punishment and was allowed to go back to playing with my cousins. 

I only remember the drawing on the wall part of the story the rest was told to me by my grandmother. 

 

A few years back I took an interest in drumming from one of my uncles and played on drums whenever I could get my hands on a set. OfCourse I then wished for drums on my birthday that wasn't too far away.  

My parents told me beforehand that I wasn't allowed any form of acoustic drums because they were too noisy. That was fair in my eyes, OfCourse they didn't want drums slamming through the house, so I got silent electric drums. 

I then proceeded to ask my parents for drumming lessons, but they told me it was expensive and there was no one in the area. I then instead asked them for singing lessons because that interested me aswell - they told me no. 

A few years later my brother started taking up bass, he however didn't get I silent bass and still to this day blasts bass sounds through the house. Not only that he got a bass teacher. 

I have far more examples but if I wrote them all this post would be too long, and this is just to get my point across.  

I also realize that I am the older brother and therefor has more responsibility and is expected to be more mature. 

I feel like our relationship can’t begin to heal before they admit this favoritism. I realize this is a giant ask, and my grandmother and therapist told me parents rarely admit this type of stuff before the sibling that was spoiled admits it, and I know my brother wont.  

Tl;dr I 18(M) has mental issues such as depression and impostor syndrome and recently found out from my grandmother that the feelings I had felt of unfair treatment in my childhood wasn't just something i imagined. 

I’m thinking of confronting my parents but is not sure of how or if i should even do it, but I feel like our relationship won't heal before they admit the differential treatment between me and my brother.

Feeling Lost,"I (22F) and my boyfriend (22M) have been in a relationship for the past 8 months. Recently, I feel like our relationship is becoming more of a routine for us and less passionate than it once was. I understand that as the honeymoon phase ends, things start to settle down but i can't help but miss when we first began dating. My boyfriend used to be a lot more reassuring and attuned to my feelings, but lately it's like he's been dismissive of them. For example, the other day i was having a panic attack and i called my bf while he was on break for reassurance and he basically just said that ""he doesn't know what to say"" when i get emotional like this. In the past, he would have comforted me and tell me that he's always there to support me and that he loves me no matter what.

I don't know what caused a change or if it's just stress from work. I've addressed this multiple times and reassured him that i'm listing if he needs to talk about something that's been bothering him, but he just says that nothing's wrong. I've become increasingly frustrated and i've tried to not lash out or do anything impulsive like i might've in the past due to poor emotional regulation. Im wondering if it's because we need space or that he's getting bored of me. Besides this, he's everything i've ever wanted in a partner: kind, attentive, affectionate and great sex. I just don't know how to get past this resentment that is starting to build up. Any advice would be helpful!

My 18M gf 18F doesn't seem to care about anything,"
We have been dating for 3-4 years now and she's always been kind of immature and uncaring sometimes, but she grew up in a really bad environment and I've given her a lot of slack and tried to do my best for her. 

Recently, I was able to ""provide"" a living situation for her to get out of the house she was in, long story short because I moved into a place with her and moved from a much better position to a worse one, she was able to escape her situation. 

Her parents are both alcoholics, didnt care about her, and her brother is a perv and there is a case in progress on him right now involving both of us.

I helped her move out, I did a lot of the work and comforted her the whole time, and her dad screamed us out piss drunk one night and I helped her figure out what to do after that. 

Additionally, since she just got her license I bought a car for her to use until she can buy it off of me because my uncle knows cars really well and I got her a really reliable car for a good price so she doesn't have to worry about car market at all. 

Since all of that, it's been several months, she hasn't really acted at all grateful about any of it, and I've expressed my concerns with her several times. I talked about how I am trying really hard and it feels like she doesn't care, but she said she was ""too overwhelmed"" to be grateful and nothing ever changed. 

She also constantly makes a mess of the house, gets upset at me when I nicely ask her about it, and brings up any small thing I've left out or mess I've made to negate hers. Her messes usually take up the entirely of the floor space, or attract ants, and she uses double the water I do because of the constant washing clothes because she doesn't keep track. 

She always asks a lot of me, in terms of comfort, or help, or reassurance, which I get because she has issues and can be sensitive, but whenever I ask for things it just upsets her. She doesn't seem to really care about my feelings, or hobbies, or anything about me. She only cares about how things affect her, she recently said to me herself that she cares about my feelings because of how I could act differently towards her. (For context I was discussing with her that I was concerned it didn't bother her at all when she did something wrong that made me upset)

She also constantly complains to me about every single difficult aspect of any day she works, even on days I work double and am exhausted. I still listen and comfort her, but I don't think it matters to her that I work a lot too. 

Just the other day, while driving my car on an insurance owned by my mom she was celebrating and drank a little bit then drove my car 6 hours later. When I was concerned and upset about it she assured me she knew she was fine, even though there isn't a way to know certainly you don't smell like alcohol or blow even .001. 
Since she's underage, and relying on several other people's things it was a risk to me and my mom and I think justifiably really upset me.  She essentially said ""fine I won't do it again"" and has no remorse, refuses to apologize because she's not sorry, and thinks she's fully right. 
When we argues about it she told me all her friends think she's right, but I saw what she said to them and she explained it in a way to specifically get them to think that way by leaving details out or exaggerating.

Another thing, there was one or two times we nearly broke up, but she just made me feel really bad about where she'd go or what she'd do. She didnt seem upset about it, more like okay, whatever this is just happening to me of course. We ended up discussing an open relationship, which was her idea, because she apparently just couldnt do anything or change so we should add someone else to help. I didnt like it at first but tried to go along, but she never put any intention or effort in so it seems like just biding time with something neither of us wanted.

TLDR; My girlfriend acts immature, doesn't seem to care about how anything affects me, and refuses to try to change because it's just ""how she is""

There's a lot of other things, but it's hard to keep track of it in my mind and I feel like it all disappears. Am I being unreasonable? What can I do? ",0,1l2gblc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2gblc/my_18m_gf_18f_doesnt_seem_to_care_about_anything/
Boyfriend lacks motivation to become independent,"Hi, so I (21M) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (20M), for 3 years now, and we started dating in high school. I left home to go to college in state, and he’s stayed at home. We come from very different backgrounds. I am an only child with parents who financially support me (helping me with rent as I go through school) and he has grown up in abject poverty, no hot water for the past while, living with grandparents as his parents have never been in the picture.

Over the past 3 years, since graduating he managed to hold one job helping a local business, but the hours were at most 10-12 hours a week, before he eventually quit sometime early last year due to a bad environment and boss.

He still doesn’t have his license, and the area we grew up in has absolutely zero public transit. He hasn’t had a job since, and I  brought it up finally last November that I need him to work towards something instead of sitting at home all day and playing video games/watching tv/smoking weed. (I have had my phases of being a stoner too, to be honest and fair, but it hasn’t impacted my grades or work ethic).

He reacted harshly to that, and felt attacked, though I admit I could have phrased some things better. I keep bringing it up occasionally, finally pushed him to go to therapy his family could work with (community services, group counseling, which isn’t the most ideal) but he still barely applies to jobs or puts more effort into learning to drive. I know he is depressed and has mental health struggles. I want to be there for him and help but I just feel this huge imbalance in our relationship as we have transitioned out of teenagehood into adulthood.

I brought it up again recently, and he gets upset and says I cannot understand because  I have always had all of my needs met, I didn’t grow up in his family or lack of support, and I agree I don’t understand, but it’s not an excuse to not do more of what you can. It’s been months since I first brought it up and there’s still been no greater progress.

Some of my friends who know us both well suggest I try to wait it out, and hope he gets it together eventually. I will say he’s very sweet and kind, and does a lot for me when we are together. These issues have just been getting louder to me and I am fearing it will not change. I no longer feel secure in our relationship.

I apologize for the long post. If anyone has advice for me, I would love to hear it. Thank you internet strangers.

TLDR - Fiest told my (21M) bf (20M) of 3 years last November I need him to start working towards something; job, license, etc. He has made no progress more than beginning group counseling in that time, and reacts harshly and shuts down when I bring it up again.

Struggling a lot with a hot and cold friendship with someone who matters a lot to me (both 23M),"Hey,

I'm having a hard time dealing with a hot and cold friendship with a former classmate I met a year ago. We're both 23M and the first time we met, there was an undeniable spark. We went on a few dates, we hooked up but he ended up making me understand that he didn't want anything serious to happen. We were classmates so obviously it made the dynamics a bit hard to navigate.

It hurt but I was okay with it after a few weeks, and we reconnected. We decided we wanted to be friends : we have a lot of common interests, similar values and it's clear we enjoy each other's company. And it quickly became a close friendship : we used to have lunch just the two of us at least one week, we sent each other messages every day for a whole month, we were very close. Over time, he introduced me to his group of friends : we went to nightclubs with only his best friend and I at least twice a month, he made me meet his childhood friends. Basically I felt included.

I'm not going to lie, at the beginning I knew I had feelings for him, and I think I made it obvious even though it was in subtle ways. But since about 4 months ago, I can say confidently that I see him as a friend and that I don't want anything more to happen. It's a friendship that matters a lot to me, because I appreciate him for who he is despite his flaws that became evident over time, but also for everything he brings me. He's the most ""fun"" friend I have, and I need that at this point in my life. He's also the only gay friend I have, and I think that it adds a layer of complexity to this whole situation.

The issue is that he's very hot and cold, and he has acted like that for months. There's been multiple times when I thought the friendship was over, only for him to come back and invite me again after I messaged him. There's a very weird dynamic between us : he's always the one inviting me in real life, and I'm always the one initiating messages. We've never had a conversation about the dynamics of our friendship, and maybe that's the issue. When I text him, he will sometimes answer very quickly, and sometimes he will take 2 days to do so. When that happens, I can't help but think I'm too much, like I'm overtexting and that's why he pulls away.

This behavior has been more and more evident recently. He used to like all of my instagram stories, but he hasn't done so in the past two weeks. He hasn't wished me a happy birthday 3 weeks ago even though he knew when it was. He was distant the last time I saw him with his friends, even though the week before he acted like a close friend. He will keep the conversations going when I text him, but always in a dry way. Yet he continues to do things that prove I matter for him. He invited me to his birthday in his hometown with his two best friends. He implied that he misses the time when we used to text each other every day (back in October). He has introduced me to all of his close friends. He often gives me compliments (about my personnality, my outfits ...).

So I'm confused. And these days, I feel like a big part of my self-confidence is linked to his invitations and the attention he brings me. Which is unhealthy, I know, but I value this friendship a lot : he's the only friend I can do stuff like going to concerts or nightclubs. He's my only gay friend as well, and that matters a lot to me. I really think we could become almost best friends at this point, but it's like he's doing everything to make it impossible to happen.

So I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice ?

**TL;DR : I'm having a very hard time dealing with a hot and cold friendship that started in a close way. But now I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. The friendship matters a lot to me and I don't want to lose it, but maybe I'm losing my self-respect by accepting his behavior.**",2,1l26uf5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l26uf5/struggling_a_lot_with_a_hot_and_cold_friendship/
I 18M am not sure if I love my girlfriend 17F. What should I do,"I've realised lately that I've struggled with understanding and managing my emotions, it's hard for me to describe them or feel them in certain moments. I've been dating this girl for almost 6 months, and the excitement I've felt has been dwindling to the point I'm not even sure if I know how I feel towards her, But I know she is completely attached towards me. I don't really know what to do, I genuinely don't want to waste her time but at the same time I don't know if I'm making the right choice in staying. She has no real friend that she can rely on in a time like this and her home situation is terrible and if I were to add onto that by braking up with her I don't know what she would do. I wish I knew I would do this so I could warn her before this happened but I can't go back in the past. 
I don't really have a real reason why I should be feeling this way, she's basically perfect for me, she's funny smart and kind but I don't know

It's weird when I had a feeling she would leave me after an argument, I felt my heart drop and I'd try to reassure her. So wouldn't that mean I do have some feelings, but at the same time if I was sure I love her then would I really be questioning? I really do care about her but I feel trapped.

(19F) and (19M) thinking about moving in together after 2 months of dating,"TL;DR: thinking about moving in with boyfriend (19M) after two months of dating

So for starters this sounds like a crazy title and I understand how it might sound or seem, but the day I met my boyfriend (19m) it was like our worlds melted together. It was love at first sight. It sounds insane and so typical “teenage love” but  we were friends first, of course and we became such good friends. Eventually we became best friends , we met about 6 months ago due to mutual friends. We discussed how we liked each other about 4 months ago and how we want to go about our love and wanting to know each other deeper than just friends.. We talked about our flaws in our past relationships and our wants and needs of how we operate and work as individuals. We agreed 2 months later about how we both feel as we want to progress and turn this friendship to more and such. We are both extremely low maintenance people. Anyways before we started officially dating I spent the night at his apartment plenty of times, that eventually progressed to more days of staying over especially once we started officially dating. We have been inseparable and so happy and both grown in a way where we both bring out the best and positive parts of each other. Don’t get me wrong we both have had our flaws and slight bickering but I will have to say I am a difficult person at times and he can be hardheaded. We have had disagreements but nothing where it went over 30min to an hour of not resolving our problems. We are great communicators and we both try our best to see where the other is coming from.That saying I have stayed over for over weeks at a time at his apartment with maybe 1-3 day breaks not because of any reaaon. besides me needing to go home and check up on my grandfather or i’m at my friends. We have basically been living together and cohabiting since we started dating. Everything came natural and our communication of our needs became natural as well. Relating to the title he has to move out of his apartment back into his parents for around at least 6 months. He is saving money  up to put down on a house. Where he is asking me to move in with him officially. I see no problem and I have been with him this whole time we both are the same about our cleanliness but he is a bit more messier and I brought it up how I wish he would clean the dishes more often instead of leaving them in the sink, quickly after I mentioned that he slowly got better about cleaning up his dishes and making sure he isnt leaving them all in the sink to just stink up the kitchen. He has been great at expressing his needs or what he needs me to do around his apartment since I practically live there. I want some insight as to how I should go about this or from someone who has gone through a similar situation or experience as I am going through. I love this man with my entire heart and have never felt so secure and strongly about someone and a relationship with someone. I would love advice from people who can vouch or share their experiences and what they wish or should’ve felt like they should’ve done in the past.

25F with 29M BF First boyfriend experience,"First boyfriend going strong for 2 years now had dates with guys before but was not interested. Is it wrong of me to feel like I want to experience other connections? 

I love my BF I just feel there are certain expectations in two big areas for me that he is just not meeting after we have talked about it plenty times. Without going into details it’s nothing major but it’s a big thing I realize I want more of in a partner. He is great and nice and I love him. I also feel bad for feeling this way. I want to work it out because it is great but I also feel like I maybe didn’t truly get to explore myself and other options to figure out more on what I want with this being my first relationship 

 TL;DR Is this normal for a first BF experience to feel hesitations and wanting to explore more options of what I want?

"I (22F) love my boyfriend (26M), but I feel like I’m doing all the emotional work. Am I asking for too much?","For context, we’ve been dating on and off since I was 19. We broke up once due to long distance and got back together about a year later. I really love him and often envision a future together. We both talk about it a lot. He’s smart, funny, and charming in many ways. But lately, I’ve been feeling lonely and wondering if love is supposed to feel like this.

Recently, it feels like I’ve been the one doing all the emotional heavy lifting. I make the effort to communicate, to understand him, to create space for connection. He does show up for me when something big is happening, like the death of a loved one or when I am overwhelmed by exams. But we are still long distance, and because of our studies and life circumstances, this will be the case for at least another three years. Sometimes, connection feels so hard to reach.

He says he is not very romantic and doesn’t care much about small things, so the only thing he consistently does is send good morning texts. When I ask for little things that make me feel closer to him, like occasional voice memos because I miss his voice, he sends one that lasts ten seconds and complains because he says he hates doing it. When I ask for compliments, he brushes it off, saying that if he didn’t think I was attractive, he wouldn’t be dating me. Once, I sent him a photo after getting a haircut and all he said was, “It’s not bad.” I’ve told him before how much that hurts, but when I bring up these things, hoping to be understood, it often turns into a debate or I end up feeling guilty for being “too sensitive.”

He has told me directly that emotions are just something you control and move on from. That he doesn’t feel the need to talk about them, because he is an adult and just deals with them. He said he only engages with emotional conversations because I care, not because he gets it himself. He also said he feels like he is more emotionally mature than me because he can “just move on” from things without needing to talk or process them.

The hardest part is that this has become a pattern. I’ve communicated these needs more than once. We even had a long, honest conversation recently, and I thought we really got somewhere. He said he understood, said he would try harder, but not even a day later he did not do any of the 3 little things he had promised to do (I know change takes time, but really? Not a single one out of 3?). In that same conversation, he told me that I am number five on his list of priorities, after family, work, school, and fishing, which is his main hobby. I am not asking to be number one, but being told I rank below a hobby, one that already takes so much of his time and attention, really hurt. Especially because I try so hard to be there for him, even when it is inconvenient for me.

When I shared how I felt, he said that this is just how it is right now, and that when we are in the same city or married someday, things will be different. But also said he wouldn’t make those sacrifices now because I could leave him and then he would be left with nothing, no friends or hobbies like last time. I understand that fear, but I also wonder, is it fair to ask me to wait for love that feels more present?

I guess what I’m asking is… am I expecting too much? Is it okay to want more emotional effort? He says he loves me, and I love him too, but I’m starting to question if this is what a relationship should feel like. Thank you for reading this far. Any thoughts would really mean a lot.

**TL;DR**: I (22F) love my boyfriend (26M), and we talk about a future together. But I’ve been feeling increasingly lonely and emotionally unsupported. He says emotions are something you just control, and I often feel dismissed or misunderstood when I try to connect. He promised to try harder after a recent talk but quickly went back to old patterns. Am I asking for too much, or is this something worth being concerned about?",3,1l245f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l245f2/i_22f_love_my_boyfriend_26m_but_i_feel_like_im/
I believe my relationship has become toxic.,"im (17f) and my boyfriend is (17m) 
so basically, my boyfriend runs cross country and track. recently he found out he needs to go to the cardiologist due to palpitations, and because of this, he cant run until he does. additionally, his team goes on this trip to a lake 6 hours away every year and he wanted to get out of it because its a week away from me and he doesnt want to do that. because he cant run, he cant go on that trip either. so basically, he gets to spend time with me, but the cost is that he loses the cross country season. he told me ""im glad i get to spend time with you, but honestly, i dont think it's worth it."" and that hurt my feelings and i told him that it did
he chose to ignore me for several hours until the next day where he told me he ""didnt mean it like that"" and all sorts of things. 
then theres the next day. i called him and i told him it hurt my feelings and i started venting to him. somewhere in there i said ""I didn't know you were serious when you told me that you use me for motivation in running"" and SOMEHOW that offended him. and hes accusing me of hurting him now, and because i did, hes choosing to ignore me. 
im hurt because all i was doing was trying to explain how what he said hurt my feelings and this is the outcome, he makes it about himself. He has ignored me for 4 days now. He sends me one short text here and there but otherwise, completely ignores me. He sent me a text yesterday, where he said his mother called me a manipulator and a bad person. he hasnt talked to me since. im so sad. and so hurt. We have almost been together a year. He also made his mom lie for him and claim they were going to a birthday party and thats why he wouldn't text me
his 11 year old sister texted me, saying they never went to a birthday party. so hes lying to me, too. how bad is this? am i really a manipulator? all i wanted was for him to listen to me and VERBALLY apologize and mean it 

TLDR: My boyfriend said I wasnt worth it and now im being called manipulative for calling him out on it. ",0,1l2438v,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l2438v/i_believe_my_relationship_has_become_toxic/
How to deal with disapproving parents?,"TL;DR - parents have become disapproving of partner because of a break in working/studying despite it being only a few months. partner is still trying to support me anyway he can but parents are insistent on blocking out our relationship.

I (21F) have been dating my partner (22m) for over a year now. It started wonderfully, and initially I thought I had my parents support in pursuing a relationship with him. He had a full time job, is looking into studying in a medical field, and we both have the same ideals and values with one another and he quite literally makes me feel on top of the world whenever I’m with him.

After a few months of dating, he had left his full time job to pursue his studying, but had to defer due to being sick and missing out on a good portion of his coursework. Since then, he’s been looking into finding a job to get that stability back before going back to his studies but has had no luck as of yet. In this time, we’ve still been going out on dates where sometimes I pay and sometimes he does too despite being out of work. We’ve decided to just take our time with things, and it’s been great because we know where we are at in our lives. I should emphasise I don’t feel as though I’m being inhibited at all as my own job is enough to get me by. I’m willing to support him, but he’s insisted on doing things on his own in order for me to achieve my own goals.

My parents, however, have taken a complete turn on the relationship where they now continuously make comments about my relationship and him being out of work and not currently studying. I’ve repeatedly explained to them the situation he’s in as he truly has been trying to get back up on he’s feet, but it’s just taking a bit more time than we both initially had thought.

I don’t doubt the relationship whatsoever and he makes me so very happy. We don’t live together just yet and both live at home still, so that has made things easier when it comes to saving and getting by financially in the meantime. We still both want to get a stable career and income before moving in!

But now it has gotten to the point where they don’t even ask about him anymore, and whenever I bring up seeing him my parents become so tense or make another comment that just brings me down. I feel so anxious trying to navigate my relationship around them that it feels like if I try to say something it’ll turn into an argument. They’ve begun doing weird things by trying to put up a curfew whenever we’re going out to have dinner or just hangout, and even try making comments about how other men would be “perfect” for me because of their status and wealth.

I genuinely see a future with my partner, and it’s frustrating that my parents haven’t even given him a chance or vested much interested in it the moment there’s been a setback out of our control. They don’t seem to understand that we are taking our time and know where we ourselves are at in the relationship.

How do I make them see eye to eye with me? And if I can’t, how do I move forward with their disapproval and judgement?",2,1l23s1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l23s1d/how_to_deal_with_disapproving_parents/
I 28f feel stuck and rejected in an 8 year relationship where marriage is off the table??,"I (28f) and my boyfriend (29m) have been together for 8 years in August. I feel stuck and need advice. On mobile so apologies for formatting. Im upset too so I apologize if this is just nonsense rambling. 

I have always wanted to get married. (This is important for later) but backstory... 
The first 5 years of our relationship was incredibly toxic. I had no family (my parents were physically and emotionally abusive, and turned my extended family against me) and fell quickly into a codependency with him. We fought constantly, said horrible things to each other, and were just nasty. At one point, he proposed to me, and I was overjoyed. I now believe he was doing that to get back at my family. We had lived with my mother at the time, and he did work on her house in exchange for payment for a truck. She lost her mind one night, kicked us out, and took it all back. I believe now that he proposed to try and get some sort of revenge on my mother, as he wanted to post it on Facebook and all that (which he never posts on there) and I was still friends with my father on FB at the time. A year later, he went from calling me his fiance to his girlfriend, and eventually pretended it never happened. Fast forward to now. Things have been better. We dont scream at each other anymore, talk things out, and take space when we need to if one of us (or both) gets too upset. As stated before, I have always wanted to get married. I know to many, it's just a piece of paper. But to me, it shows a commitment not only to someone, but a commitment from that someone else. Its 2 people saying ""hey, I want to tackle LIFE with you. All of it. The good the bad the ugly. We are a team and we are doing this together. I want to be bound to you!"" Admittedly, the past few years we were not super financially stable, and he said he wanted to wait until we were to consider it, which i understood. He told me a year ago he sees us getting married in a few years.  Now,  we are in a better spot, and he has been talking to me about starting a family and buying a house together, or renting one with space to grow a family. Today, he brought it up again, and I told him I would want to be married first. He laughed it off, and called me silly, and said ""oh you know that piece of paper is so important."" I told him I was serious, it's very important to me, and I would want to be married. He said ""oh yeah, you and your catholic beliefs."" I am not even catholic. I was taken aback, and didn't say anything until we got home. I brought it up again later, saying that it hurt me, and it is important to me, and I'm not even catholic. He apologized and said he was joking, and I told him it's not a joke to me, it's something I've always wanted, and it doesn't make me feel good that im expressing my feelings and hes making jokes. He apologized again, and i asked him if he ever sees us getting married, and he said he didn't know. I just told him it's very important to me, and I've made that known the entire 8 years we've been together, and he just said okay.  

It just feels like a slap in the face. I remember him making fun of his dad for waiting till him and his step mom were together for 9yrs to propose, saying how he shouldve done it 5 years sooner. Saying similar things about other couples. I dont know what to do or think. I love this man. We've gone through so much and grown so much together, and I feel like, why am I not good enough?? If it's truly just a piece of paper to him, why can't he just do it? I don't want to end this. But I don't know what to do. When I try and talk to him seriously, he just shuts down and apologizes or goes to bed. I just dont know what to do or what to say, or how to approach this without sounding like a jerk making an ultimatum. I guess I just needed to vent if anything and hope for advice.

How do I (19F) know when it’s time to stop fighting for effort?,"Me 19F and my boyfriend 19M have been dating for 8 months. We met the first week of college and lived in the same dorm. We basically moved in together immediately and lived together for 6 months. So although our relationship is only 8 months old, we have grown quite close.

About a month ago, we left college for summer break. We are a 17 hour drive or $500 flight apart. I am working 50+ hours a week because I pay for everything on my own (tuition, car payments, food, etc.) He is working at a summer camp. I text/call him every day to update him about the little things and stories I have. He won’t respond for hours at a time, often over 24 hours. Since he is at this camp, I understand that he won’t be able to check his phone much. However, it feels like he isn’t putting in effort. I am working 50+ hours a week but am constantly wanting to update him with the little victories. Due to his lack of response recently, I’ve stopped reaching out as much. Maybe 1 or 2 texts in a day. He hasn’t appeared to notice.

He called me back for the first time in a week tonight. I brought up how I felt a little neglected and wanted more communication. Communication has been a recurring problem in our relationship, and in long distance it is especially important. He said I needed to calm down and stop letting my emotions take control. I told him that I think it’s normal to have these emotions when you miss your partner, and I don’t want to push them away. He told me he had to go do something (at 11pm?) and hung up on me before I got to say goodbye. This really hurt my feelings. I texted him asking him to please not hang up on me and that I just wanted 20 minutes of his time. It’s been a few hours and no response. I’m exhausted and hurt.

I love this man, I really do. I want to work through this and I don’t want to give up. But it is so hard when I feel like he isn’t showing up for me. How should I approach this the next time I talk to him? When do I know when it’s time to reconsider my relationship? I really love him. I also want to note that although we are the same age, there is definitely a maturity difference. I’m wondering if this is just a maturity issue or if this is going to be a problem that will persist if I don’t make change.

TL;DR Me (19F) and my partner (19M) are long distance for the summer and having communication issues. How do I handle this?",0,1l22ra9,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l22ra9/how_do_i_19f_know_when_its_time_to_stop_fighting/
My (24M) girlfriend (21F) had a falling out with her friends and won't acknowledge my opinion,"I (24M) have been with my girlfriend (21F) for about a year. We love each other a lot but I fear her actions towards me are making me walk on eggshells and avoid being myself. That's not the kind of relationship I want and I know it needs to change.

About a week ago, my girlfriend had a falling out with her friends that she's known since school. In short, there was a birthday celebration for one of her friends scheduled for a particular day. In the leadup to that day, one of her other friends said she couldn't come because she was spending time with another friend outside the group. My girlfriend was upset that her excuse was to spend time with another friend, and told her this. I admire my girlfriend for sticking up for the friend whose birthday celebration it was. But this started an argument in the group (all over text), and my girlfriend told another girl (who she doesn't like much) to ""stfu"".

I don't think it's ever excusable to say that. The girl she said it to was being nosey but she didn't have to be rude in return. My girlfriend refused to apologise to her, and now my girlfriend has left the friend group. I believe she still owes an apology but she believes very strongly that she doesn't because the other girl is a ""b\*tch"".

She has told me a lot about this issue and I've tried to comfort her. It's been a difficult time for her, understandably (although I would say mostly brought on by herself). I tried to look past my own discomfort the whole time without judging her actions. I let her do what she felt was best, told her this, and didn't try to change her mind, even though what she was doing felt wrong to me. I've met the friends a couple of times but they're not my friends and I know I have no place telling her what to do. I was fine with that.

But the thing that hurt me more was the way that she dealt with our differring views. I would have hoped that she would ask for my opinion on her actions, value it and we could have a good conversation where we listen to each other and feel better. But that is only in a perfect world, and I knew from the start that she wouldn't be open to that because of how stubborn she is. That hurt a bit, but I was coping.

But then when she was ranting about the issue, and I wasn't saying much in response, she explicitly asked me for my opinion. I told her that whilst her friends have been thoughtless and rude, I thought she was also being rude and she owed an apology. Maybe I could have phrased it a bit more gently, but it was honest and calm, without judgement. She then yelled and swore at me, and the interaction ended there.

Later, she told me she wanted to hear my opinion but only if it doesn't hurt her (paraphased). That really hurt me. I was trying hard to comfort her, I thought I was doing exactly what she wanted, I was just being myself. But that wasn't enough for her - it got me verbally abused and hurt. That should never happen in a relationship. Of course I don't want to hurt her, but I also want to be able to say what I think without fear of being yelled at or blamed for my opinions.

I still haven't talked to her about this out of fear of another argument. How do I approach this without making it about the issue with her friends? I'm worried that if I bring it up as a bigger issue in our relationship it will make her feel worse and become more defensive. But if I make it about her friends she will think I'm just upset at what she said to them. Is there some middle ground?

tl;dr My girlfriend said something to her friends that I didn't agree with. She asked me for my opinion and yelled at me when I said I didn't agree.",0,1l21m2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l21m2z/my_24m_girlfriend_21f_had_a_falling_out_with_her/
"tl;dr M26 F27 been together for 2 years, I dont know what to do","tl;dr I have been with my partner for almost 2 years now, we got together very quickly after he ended his 7 year relationship with his ex (red flag already I know). They were each others first loves and my partner said even though they did have some issues, he mainly left because of his own mental health. Fast forward to our relationship, we have broken up 4 or 5 times now because of how much he still loves his ex even though we also love each other deeply. He is the love of my life, I see us one day getting married and having kids, but lastnight he told me that he may never want to do those things with me because he is scared he may always feel like his life was meant to be spent with someone else. He has tried to get her back every time we've broken up, however she has had a firm response of no every single time, even telling him to please focus his energy and attention on me because she has moved on.

I really dont know what to do here. I love him more than I know how to put into words but there's only so many times a girl can hear that their partner may never love them more than their ex and that he believes she is his soul mate and that he never should of left.

"I [F21] have been with my boyfriend [M22] for almost two years. I'm worried that the passion is gone, and I'm scared of the future if I stay in this relationship forever. What should I do?","Is the passion gone? While deleting some old notes I (F20) caught a glimpse of old poems and paragraphs dedicated to him (M20) and the way he made me feel. I’m not sure I feel that way anymore. The words look foreign, as if someone else had written them for me. I love him, I know that for sure, but it might not be a burning, passionate love. I think that it has evolved into a safe, secure, comfortable love. I'm not sure if I want that, but I also know it's far fetched to have passion forever in a relationship. I don’t think anyone could treat me as well as he does. 

But, that could be the wrong way to think. When we first started dating, I loved the way he spoke and the way his mind worked. I loved how sweet and compassionate he was, I looked at him with adoration and intrigue. Although I do still love and cherish these things about him, I have found recently that they have fallen from the top of the list. Right now I think most about how he treats me. How he’s so sweet and understanding, so loving and kind and willing to do almost anything for me. 

Some concerning thoughts have crept their way into my mind like snakes, slipping through the underbrush unnoticed until they’re right in front of you. Do I love him or do I love the way he treats me? Am I in this relationship because I don’t think anyone could be as good to me as him? Is that a valid reason to be in a relationship? And, worst of all, could I do better? I usually brush it off as me being paranoid because I’ve gotten too comfortable. I can love him *and* the way he treats me, right? 

I have also been wondering about my sexuality in tandem with these thoughts. I have long known myself to be interested in women, having previously labelled myself as queer and bisexual, however I have not had many opportunities to explore that side of myself. I have never kissed a woman properly in a romantic context, I have never dated a woman, never had sex with a woman, gone on a real date with a woman… My concern is that if I choose to stay in this relationship for the long run, marriage and whatnot, will I regret not exploring that aspect of who I am? Twenty years from now, will I wake up in the middle of the night, plagued with regret over things I never got to do? 

I do love him. I love spending time with him, he understands me and I like to think I understand him and we get each other. I am happy being with him in the present moment, that is not the issue in the slightest. I think the future scares me. I think I’m scared of being trapped in a mediocre relationship stuck wondering about the things I could have done and the people I could have dated. It seems silly and shallow, but if I stay in this relationship for the rest of my life, will I feel okay having only had sex and properly been with two people? I have only been with one other man before him, and that relationship lasted about 7 months. 

I think deep within me there is this want to be wild and free and hot and carnally desired by every stranger I meet. I want to have crazy stories to tell one day to my kids or my nieces or whoever I feel should hear them. I want to be the coolest person I know. I am terrified of one day becoming mediocre and boring. Deep down I’m petrified, truly scared of being boring and limited by another person. I can’t limit myself to just being someone’s wife or mother. I cannot be seen as what I am to other people. I believe I might be a selfish person. I’m not sure what to do about that. I don’t know if that’s something I need to fix or feel ashamed of. I’m not sure what to do going forward. Has anyone else felt this way? What did you do about it? This is mostly just a rant post to organize my thoughts, but I need some outside perspective, if you have any to offer I appreciate it. 

  
TL;DR: I (F20) love my boyfriend (M20), but I’m realizing my love has changed — it feels more safe and comfortable than passionate. I wonder if I love *him* or just how well he treats me. I’m also questioning my sexuality and worry that staying in this relationship forever means I’ll miss out on exploring that side of myself, and life in general. I fear becoming boring, trapped, or limited by commitment. Has anyone else felt this way, and what did you do?

"My (19M) best friend (18M) wants to distance himself from me in college, what should I do?","Me and my best friend have known each other for 3 years and we have been doing great. Nonetheless, he recently told a common friend (19F) that he doesn’t want to hang out much with me in college and want to have his own friend group instead (He is coming to the college I currently study at). For context, I am one year older and graduated before him, and he was only friends with me and other people in my grade, so when we left, he had no friends. He doesn’t want that to happen again in college but I am sure he can have other friends without having to sacrifice our friendship. We have never had any big issues as friends but he has had issues holding other friendships in place when they have been long. In addition, we are not “too close” as we don't always hangout together all the time. I really don’t want us to fall off, so I want to talk to him to prevent a friendship downfall. Even after he said that, we have been doing great, so I am not entirely sure why he would say that about me. However, I don’t know if I should confront him about this or how I should do so.

"my (22F) partner (21F) recently told me that she does not experience the feeling of excitement, ever. Should I tell her that this bothers me?","As the title says partner told me recently that she does not feel excitement over anything. To clarify, she is not suffering with depression or low mood, she simply said she has never felt the feeling of excitement. She also told me she doesn’t really experience “missing people” the same way others do. AKA she doesn’t actually get a feeling like she misses people. We have been together for a few years now and although we are young I can see our relationship lasting. We never argue, we are generally on the same page about everything and we tend to communicate very well. For context, I am someone that really wants a family in the future and to get married, this is really important to me. Since she has said that she doesn’t really experience excitement I can’t stop thinking about it. When I asked if she’d be excited before our wedding day or if we were going to start a family she simply said no, probably not. (Bear in mind that she is the one who has said multiple times that she wants that in the future with me). She explained that it’s not that she doesn’t want those things, she just doesn’t get excited. I don’t know why but it is bothering me so much. I adore her and she’s an amazing partner but I worry that I would feel that she wasn’t excited everytime we move forward in our relationship and that would always bother me. If anyone else experiences this (not feeling any excitement) please let me know for my peace of mind!

Partner’s coparent hates me,"TL;DR my bf’s ex is hateful and I don’t know how to handle the situation. 

My bf (40M) and I (48F) have been dating for almost a year and we both have kids from our previous marriages. We have spent the past 6 months with each other’s kids getting comfortable, we’ve done long vacations together, been through some personal challenges, and stay the night together several times a week. We’ve been discussing moving in together in the next year as it seems like everyone gets along well and we have a really happy bond forming together already.

However, his ex wife has been a real challenge to deal with. She talks badly about my bf in front of the kids, incites arguments and triangulates by involving their mutual friends and his family. She even went so far as to call CPS to make some bullshit report on him, resulting in their kids having to be interviewed by social services (investigation was closed with nothing to find). She has told the kids that we shouldn’t be moving in together because my bf “barely knows” me and my child. She refuses to call me by name, always referring to me as “that woman.” She definitely does not want to meet me or make nice. Mind you, I had nothing to do with their divorce and didn’t meet him until after they had separated so it’s not like she has a reason to hate or distrust me. She has also been dating someone for the same amount of time so it’s not like he is the only one “moving on.” The kids love me and my child and enjoy spending time with us. The ex just dislikes me simply because I’m the new girlfriend I guess.

I’m assuming this must be a fairly common scenario so I’m curious as to how others may have navigated a relationship with someone who coparents with a spiteful ex spouse. I know at some point we are going to have to interact and based on her ongoing antics I’m pretty nervous about how she’s going to react to me in person. I’m also worried about her badmouthing me to the kids or even finding new ways to lash out at my bf going forward. And what if she’s hellbent on making us miserable or breaking us up and she manages to succeed? I am very  much in love with him but trying to be both cautious and practical as I don’t want the kids to be dragged into or impacted by this.

Whenever I confront him about all these times he's been sneaky, he throws it back in my face that I still speak to certain men, when that isn't the case.

Our values align, we want the same things from life, and we’ve done all the good stuff like meeting parents etc. which has all gone swimmingly. 

The thing is - we argue, **a lot.** In hindsight, I should have spotted the pattern sooner, it did start fairly early on. I guess I’ve just always thought that it’ll get better as we get closer or whatever. 

I think part of the difficulty has been the unpredictability of the arguments (it’s not like one topic sets things off and we can just avoid that topic) and how self aware she is post argument, taking responsibility, explaining where things came from, creating a path for things going forward. 

Anyway, it sort of turns out that’s all just talk. It isn’t getting any better. And now I’ve figured out there has been a pattern all along. It’s insecurity. I noticed it when it became a bedroom related issue. She started initiating sex, and if I didn’t respond exactly as she wanted (the right level of enthusiasm, in a time sensitive manner) she took it as a personal insult and said that I’d essentially “rejected” her. It was an issue if I wasn’t in the mood, but it was also an issue if for instance she said “let’s have sex tonight” and then later that night I’d say “shall we watch another episode before bed?” - in that instance I was “choosing tv over her”. I’d go into the bedroom after fully expecting sex and she’d have already decided herself to be rejected and in a mood about it.  

It all kind of crystallised that every argument has been driven out the back of her being insecure. I spoke to her about it, and she explained that her therapist is helping with it, and it’s rooted from childhood, and past abusive boyfriends, etc. This was at the start of the year and I kind of thought that us both knowing would help navigate it, but it hasn’t. Meanwhile, the arguments have continued and the pressure of getting the bedroom stuff right hasn’t done us any good at all. 

I guess the thing that’s messing with my head is that her insecurity is about losing me - all the bad in the relationship stems from her wanting the relationship… it’s like a horrible self-fulfilling prophecy - the more she wants it the more she hurts it. 

It feels like it’s really driving a wedge between us that can’t be removed though, even if it is coming from a non-malicious place. Writing this I feel like everyone is going to say that I’m the asshole, but I’m starting to think we’d both be happier out of this relationship. Sometimes we will go a few weeks without arguing, but mostly it’s once or twice a week, and sometimes she won’t return back to baseline for like 2-3 weeks after a particularly big upset (stemming from an often trivial point). 

Appreciate any outside perspectives & advice. 


TL;DR: We’ve been together a few years and really click in so many ways, but the arguments (usually unpredictable and rooted in her insecurity) have become constant and draining. She’s self-aware and says all the right things after, but nothing is changing, and that tension now spills into the bedroom. As much as it hurts to say, I’m starting to think we might actually be better off apart, even though all of this seems to come from her just wanting to hold onto us.",0,1l1xi2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1xi2c/i_32m_am_considering_leaving_my_girlfriend_32f_of/
I’m (30F) sick of hearing about my boyfriend’s (31M) ex wife’s (31F) drama,"TL;DR 3 years post divorce, my boyfriend still gets regular updates about his cheating ex’s shenanigans. How do I tactfully voice my distaste?

My boyfriend Paul (31M) married his high school sweetheart Sophie (31F) when they were 24. 

After 4 years of marriage he found out she was cheating with a guy from the gym named Aaron (30sM), who was not only married himself to Christina (30sF) but also had 3 kids with her. Paul only learned about the affair because Christina found out, tracked him down on Instagram, and told him everything.

Both Paul and Christina decided to get divorces, and they ended up becoming quite close friends as they supported each other emotionally throughout the process. (Before anyone says anything, I’m 100% confident that their friendship has always been platonic. I’ve met her a couple times and she’s lovely.) 

Not long after Paul said f*** it, left his hometown, and moved halfway across the country. We met a little over a year later and have now been together for almost 2 years. Both super happy, marriage seems likely in the future.

Aaron and Sophie ended up moving in together after their affair was uncovered. Shockingly, they are still together. Not shockingly, their relationship is filled with all sorts of drama - cheating, fights that end with the police being called, you name it. 

How do I know all of this? Because Christina, who is still stuck in their hometown trying to coparent with Aaron, has a front row seat to all of it. And she seemingly texts Paul with every single update.

Paul usually fills me in on the gossip. If we’re together when he gets a text I might hear him snicker at his phone and say “guess what I just heard from Christina?” and if not he’ll probably tell me about it later that day. This is part of a pattern of him generally being extremely open and transparent with me which I do really appreciate.

At first it was kind of entertaining to hear about all the drama, and I tried to be understanding because at that point everything was still relatively fresh. But nearly 2 years into our relationship, I’m really getting sick of hearing about his ex all the time.

I was also in a very long and serious relationship before I met Paul, but I haven’t kept tabs on my ex in years. No idea what state he lives in, if he’s married, has kids, whatever. And I truly don’t care. He’s not part of my life anymore.

As Paul and I start to talk more seriously about the future, I feel like I need to set a boundary. It’s almost like his ex has this presence in our lives. I don’t want to get married to someone who is still so invested in their previous marriage.

However, I know Paul’s friendship with Christina is important to him and he knows he’s one of the few people she can talk to who really understands. And I don’t want to police his friendships.

My ( 21F) boyfriend (22M) lied to me.,"To give you context, i trust or at least -used to-trust my boyfriend very much. I don’t consider myself that possessive. 
He has female friends, and so do i for male friends. 


Today, he went to do some grocery shopping, and he left his laptop open. 
When i tried to close it, i noticed that his friend (22F) called him. it was a missed call. I went to their convo to tell her that he is not here. But then i noticed her sending: 😍😍😍 wow so beautiful many times while he was thanking her. i was kinda confused, so i went up in the convo and it was him sending her a design he made on canva. No big deal obviously. 
But then the worst got of me and i kept on going up. Until i came across a text of him telling her at 13PM : where are you, her giving him his location, and fast forward to 23PM her asking him if he arrived at his place safely. 

NOW, i know about him going to meet and chill with his boyfriends that same day. But why didnt he mention to me that she was also going to be there? Did he see her alone? I really don’t mind him hanging out with her since i also hang out with my male friends but at least i tell him about it!!! 
Why did he feel the need to hide it from me. I don’t understand oh my God. Now i just don’t look at him the same anymore. Should i consider this cheating? 

TL;DR: i found in my boyfriend’s laptop a convo that alludes that he met with his female friend, all without saying anything to me. ",0,1l1xdqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1xdqu/my_21f_boyfriend_22m_lied_to_me/
"my mom won’t let me date till college, i dunno what to do i because i really like my partner (he’s my first ever!)","This is my first post in years lol but idek what to do. I (16F) decided to hint at my somewhat strict asian mom (44F) about my current (first ever) relationship and she got reaaallly mad at me. My boyfriend (16M) and i have hung out before but i always said we were just friends when she asked, cus i knew she would get mad, which is my fault lol. Technically we’ve been together for like a couple months but I guess you can say we’ve been “talking” or have had crushes on each other for at LEAST 2 years, since the start of high school. We were just too scared to put a label on it and talk to each other lmaooo

But she started going on about how I shouldn’t get into a relationship in high school —im in my junior year rn (she’d maybe let me in college) — or how she’s gonna not let me hang out with him anymore. Ofc id like my family to approve but i really like him :( (doesn’t help that he’s not the same race as my family, i think my mom would want someone the same race). She started talking about how he wasn’t the one, how she didn’t approve of him, and yeah 😔 I thought I could trust her with this information about my life, but now I really regret it :/ i rlly do like my bf! and we like each other! i dunno how it’s gonna go after high school ends but id like to stay together if our paths align! but now im pretty sure she knows we’re somewhat together and aaaaghhh. all ik is that shes hella against us in a relationship and that she won’t let me hang out with him anymore. idk what to do either cus she doesn’t like him, I don’t think him trying to warm up to her is gonna work either. But I also would really like my family to approve but I don’t think they will. any advice on how I should proceed from here?

TL;DR strict Asian mom disapproves of my relationship. don’t know where to go from here, advice on what steps I should take?

I really hope I’m following the rules for posting btw I read it I think🙏

_______
edit: she’s gonna have a talk with my dad later about it aaaaag. she made her main points clear tho
1. “we’ll be going to college in like a year, so why get into a relationship”
2. “16 is too young for a relationship” 
3. “I have to see what he can offer me in the future.” But she says it’s too early to see that, so I must “wait until college.” and also she says she can’t see what he can offer bruh😭😭

~I guess I can see how all her points are somewhat? valid but damn I just like him and wanna chill, which may be unresponsible but ughghhhegehg  :< and anyways although my ECs are pretty lacking I have a 4.0 unweighted 4.3 weighted GPA so this isn’t going to affect my grades negatively like what…im still focused on my studies chillllll",0,1l1xazh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1xazh/my_mom_wont_let_me_date_till_college_i_dunno_what/
25(F) having serious doubts about my fiance (35M),"
So my fiance (35M) and I (25F) have been together for 3 almost 4 years. He has a pending felony charge, which with anyone else would have been a deal breaker for me. He has been open and honest since the beginning and we have generally had a good relationship. He gets me and makes me laugh and makes me feel pretty safe. He gets along great with my daughter (not his biological child) and is a pretty great guy overall. There’s a few things that gnaw at my mind though.

 He is possibly facing prison time due to the pending felony and I’m not sure I’d be comfortable with waiting on him for multiple years. Number two is that about a year ago I had an emotional affair with someone that made me question everything. We worked things out and identified why I felt like my needs weren’t being met (which we had talked about multiple times leading up to this instance). He made some changes but now he hasn’t maintained those changes while I have maintained complete openness and honesty, got into therapy, and he has 24/7 access to all my devices, etc. 

A few time between then and now he has gotten drunk and said some really hurtful things to me about my past calling m terrible names and saying just really not great stuff that in those moments made me want to end it. He’s in AA now and not drinking and overall we have a great relationship but I still feel some doubt in my gut. I don’t feel fulfilled sexually but it’s because he’s stressed out and it’s hard for him to get into that space due to his medication and overall circumstances. I get it but I’m also just so unsure what to do. My daughter loves him and I love him and I know we could have a good relationship if we really want it but this doubt and anxiety is eating me alive. He is already in therapy but won’t be honest about his problems. When I think about leaving I get mixed feelings of relief and dread but when I think about staying and marrying him I feel plain dread/anxiety. I just don’t know what to do and need some real advice even if it’s hard to hear. Do I stay and work on it or do I leave and start over? 

TL;DR- Lots of issues between my fiance and I, and I’m thinking of leaving but don’t know what to do because I do truly love him. ",0,1l1wdhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1wdhe/25f_having_serious_doubts_about_my_fiance_35m/
How do I (23F) tell my boyfriend (22M) how I feel?,"I (23F) have been having issues with my boyfriend of 3.5 years. We've been under a lot of stress and arguing recently. We lived with his parents, where he and our 11 month old daughter, currently are. I had to leave for 5 days to get help with my mental health. When the time came to pick me up, he said his Mom no longer wanted to live there. So I'm now at my mom's, about 2 hours away from him. It's been a week today since I've seen our daughter. Since I've gotten home, he barely responses to my texts and when he does he doesn't really say anything and it'll take hours for him to respond. I'm worried this has ruined our relationship. 

How do I talk to him about my concerns and feeling without upsetting him? I'm worried he might take somethings the wrong way. 

If you have my advice, please let me know. Feel free to ask questions for more info, I'll do my best to answer. Thank you.

Important notes: the mental health is for my depression and mood swings (from having bi polar 1) have gotten worse since having our daughter. I am finally able to get back on my medications to help.

My Highschool Sweetheart and I are getting more serious and having children is very important to me but she does not want kids.,"Please excuse if this post isn’t in the traditional Reddit format. I seriously want to make this relationship work and just need support right now.

The Problem:

I want kids, but my girlfriend does not.

We’ve had many conversations about what our future will look like now that the relationship is getting more serious. We recently decided to pause the discussion until spring break so I can focus on school and come back to the conversation with more mental clarity.

I want to share my experience and get support for the conversations ahead when I have more emotional energy to spend on my relationship.

Background:

My partner (20F) and I (20M) have been together since 12th grade, and now we’re sophomores in college. When we first got together officially, we both made it clear that we didn’t want to marry each other. And the topic of kids never really came up. But after a few years of being together it's more serious and I'm beginning to look for areas that resentment could grow

So far, our opposite views on having children haven’t been an issue, and honestly, they probably won’t be for a very long time. But I can’t ignore the reality that women have a biological clock(I understand men also have a biological clock but not in the same way women do in terms both socially and health speaking) I could stay with my partner, hoping she changes her mind, but in 10 years, this could be a dealbreaker—and by then, I would’ve lost a decade I could’ve spent finding someone who shares my views. (I feel like a real jerk just typing that sentence. And I understand fully that 'waiting' for someone to change is wrong on many levels)



Possible Outcomes:

At this point, I see a few ways this could play out:


1.	⁠I get what I want, and she someday decides to have kids.

2.	⁠She gets what she wants, and we never have kids.

3.	⁠We find a compromise—maybe adoption or another option we both agree on.

4.	⁠We break up on good terms.

5.	⁠We break up on bad terms.


I already know #1 is wrong—I don’t want to pressure or wait around hoping she changes her mind. #2 would mean giving up something incredibly important to me.

#3 seems like an option, but I know it wouldn’t work for me. I deeply want my child to be biologically mine and my partner’s. I believe there’s nothing more meaningful than sharing that experience with someone I love.

That said, if one of us were sterile, I feel like my opinion on #3 would change. In that case, I’d absolutely consider any and all alternatives. I know there’s probably some flaw in that logic, but that’s just how I feel.

Where I’m Struggling:

I’ve never had to break up with someone before, and honestly, this would really suck. There’s no cheating, no loss of feelings—just two people who want different things.

Any Advice? How do you breakup with someone when nothing is wrong? Is there any reasons NOT to break up?

---

**TL; DR;**: My girlfriend will likely never want kids and it's unfair to my partner if I both spokenly and unspokenly want them to change their mind on something like having kids so that's not an option. How do you breakup with someone over something insignificant in the present but a big deal down the road? Should I just leave this alone until it presents itself more urgently like she wishes?",0,1l1s07z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1s07z/my_highschool_sweetheart_and_i_are_getting_more/
Do I say anything about my body insecurity after this embarrassing incident?,"I (22f) have been dating my boyfriend (26m) for about 8 months now. Never had an issue. I came over to his apartment. He knows what time I get off work, when I’ll be over. Never has an issue with me just walking in. 
Anyway I just got over to his place. It’s a small one bedroom apartment. You immediately walk into the living room. I walk in and see him masterbating at his computer in the living room. He immediately hears the loud door opening and jumps removing his headphones. And is embarrassed, left while I was in the shower without saying anything. I on the other hand. I don’t feel disgusted or mad, I know people masterbate. But I feel insecure now. Especially seeing what he was watching. I’m not the smallest, but I’m not huge either. I consistently workout, my job is very labor intensive I work in construction, but with being insulin resistant it definitely makes things hard. If anything I’m more of a muscular build with decent sized boobs with a bit of a muffin top. Than a super feminine build. But seeing what was on the screen just makes me feel awful with how I look. I’m not blonde, I’m not skinny I don’t have the ass that everyone wants. And I’m starting to think he doesn’t find me as attractive as he says he does. He doesn’t touch me much, barely have sex. We don’t go out as much. My mind is just spiraling now. And now I’m just in a place of do I even bring this up? Do I say that it triggered my body insecurity. Or should I just drop it and not remind him of this situation?

TL;DR
21F dating 26M walked in to him masterbaiting.

I feel like I’m losing myself in my relationship is it time to leave?," I (26F) am considering breaking up with my boyfriend (25M). I no longer feel like myself in this relationship.

We’ve been together for two and a half years now and when we first got together, our relationship felt incredibly healthy. There was patience, understanding, and space for both of us to express ourselves freely. I felt seen, safe, and supported. But over time, things have taken a serious turn for the worse, and I’m starting to feel lost and emotionally drained.

Now, I can’t bring up concerns or issues without him becoming defensive. Every time I try to talk about something that’s bothering me, he takes it personally, projects things onto me, or shuts down. I’ve gotten to the point where I dread communicating any discomfort because more often than not, it leads to an argument or him withdrawing emotionally, and I’m left constantly asking him to respond to what I’m saying.

Something important to note: he has diagnosed ADHD, and I suspect I may have undiagnosed ADHD myself. Early on, I really struggled to understand how his ADHD showed up in our relationship; it was a major point of contention between us. But over time, I made a conscious effort to listen more, do research, and try to meet him where he’s at. I adjusted how I communicate, gave him grace, and tried to build systems that could work for both of us.
Despite that, I’ve struggled to trust that he’ll follow through on the things he says he’ll do. Too many times I’ve been disappointed, let down, or left picking up the pieces. I’ve developed serious anxiety around this, constantly checking in, reminding him of tasks, and asking for updates because if I don’t, things often fall through the cracks. He tends to say he got distracted and blames his ADHD, and while I want to be understanding, I also don’t know where the line is between symptoms and excuses anymore.
We recently started a business together, and it’s only amplified the imbalance. I feel like I’m doing 90% of the work. He lacks initiative and rarely follows through without me prompting him, and I’ve grown so resentful and feel annoyed by him. I feel like his boss, not his partner.

Recently, his friend came over to hang out. I was in crunch mode preparing for an upcoming business event, so I participated in the conversation when I could, but most of my focus was on work. His friend eventually started doing some of his own work, and suddenly, my boyfriend started working too, which struck me as performative. It felt like he was only doing it to appear productive in front of his friend, not because he actually wanted to contribute. What hurt most was that behind closed doors, I’ve been the one doing the majority of the heavy lifting, and here he was acting like an equal partner.

Then he started discussing our business and finances in front of his friend, which really upset me. I’ve made it very clear from the beginning that I’m a private person, and I don’t like discussing our work or money with others. We had agreed on this boundary together, and he’s crossed it multiple times. I don’t like feeling like I’m bragging or oversharing personal details, and he knows this. I brought both concerns up to him later. He agreed he wouldn’t discuss our business in front of others again, but he completely invalidated my feelings about him suddenly working in front of his friend. It felt like another example of him only showing up when someone’s watching, and then minimizing my experience when I bring it up.

This pattern shows up in so many areas. Even Valentine’s Day, I had to ask him when he was planning to ask me to be his valentine (something I had previously communicated would make me feel loved). He then proceeded to do nothing for me on the day itself and when i asked why, he said “we never discussed that we would get each other gifts this year” like????? A few days ago, he wrote a letter, and yesterday he got me flowers (something he did frequently but hadn’t in a long time) but I felt numb. I didn’t believe the words in the letter. I didn’t feel anything, just indifference. And that scares me.

We’ve tried to “work on things” multiple times. A few months ago, I told him I wanted to break up, and I meant it. Then we decided to give it another shot. Two weeks later, he said he was checking out and maybe we should end it. Again, we decided to work on it. A month later, we had such an intense argument that I had a panic attack and told him I was done. But I stayed. We recently started therapy, and while he listens during sessions, the effort never lasts more than a couple of days.

At this point, I feel like I’m dragging him through life. I’ve become someone I don’t recognize, constantly in survival mode, angry, irritated, and exhausted. I used to be soft and light. Now I feel like a nag, a manager, a caretaker. I love his family and his friends, and saying goodbye to the life we built is terrifying. But staying has started to feel even scarier.

Another thing that has become increasingly difficult is his emotional reactions. He’s become much less patient, and I’ve noticed that his reactions to small things have become big and aggressive. One of the reasons I fell for him initially was because of how calm and collected he was. I never thought I’d be in a situation where I felt unsafe because of his behavior. But now, there are moments where I feel like I'm constantly in fight or flight mode because of how he reacts to things.

For example, if he gets a scratch on his finger, he’ll scream “F***!” and start freaking out, and I’m left thinking, “It’s a little cut, why are you acting like this?” Or if something external happens, like he gets cut off while driving, he can’t regulate himself at all. Or I could leave the room for like two second to grab a glass of water or something, and when I come back, he’s in a completely different mood because of something negative that happened while i was gone. Now, I’m suddenly walking on eggshells because I feel unsafe. He’s never been physically violent or directed anger at me, but the emotional intensity makes the atmosphere feel tense and volatile. I don’t know how to feel calm or safe when I’m constantly adjusting to his unpredictable moods.

I thought this was the person I would spend the rest of my life with. I just miss my sweet boy and wish we could go back to when things weren’t like this  

Has anyone experienced something like this? How do you know when it’s truly time to leave? I’ve stayed hoping things would get better, but I’m miserable. I want to feel like me again.


TL;DR:
My relationship started off healthy and supportive, but over time it’s become draining and unbalanced. My boyfriend has ADHD (diagnosed), and while I’ve worked hard to support him, I feel like I’m constantly managing him and our life. Communication has broken down, I don’t feel emotionally safe, and I’m always walking on eggshells due to his mood swings. We run a business together, but I do most of the work and feel more like his boss than his partner. I’ve tried to leave before but stayed out of hope. Now, I feel numb, resentful, and like I’ve lost myself. How do you know when it’s really time to walk away?

"I’m (32M) frustrated with the lack of time and effort from my girlfriend (25F). It feels like any free time we have together is just a place holder, I don't feel like a priority in her life and more of a convenience. Is this going to be an issue?","I’m (32M) frustrated with the lack of time and effort from my girlfriend (25F). It feels like any free time we have together is just a place holder, until something else comes along, and it led to me not feeling like a priority in her life and more of a convenience.

For context, we’ve been dating for little over a year, and about 8 months ago I moved up to her location where she’s been living with her parents and stayed within her area (I lived in a camper van), until about 2 months ago, I then moved into an apartment. When the idea of an apartment came up with both agreed that she would eventually move in, we both signed a lease for a place that would reduce her commute from about 40 minutes to 10, picked furniture together...etc. She hasn’t “officially” moved in yet and her time at the apartment usually revolves around her work schedule and her other “obligations”.

 Now for the issues, it feels like every time she’s here at the apartment on one of her days off, something comes up that causes her to leave (usually something with her mom) and I’m lucky to get maybe half a day together. Despite us talking the night or days before about what we would like to do, whatever comes up takes precedence.

The latest example, she just got back from a 3-day trip (preparing for an upcoming diving trip) with her mom on Friday night, she then had Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday free before she leaves for 12 days on this diving trip with her mom. I thought, cool, we’ll at least have some quality time to spend together. Well, Friday night she told me that she made brunch plans with one of her long-term friends for Saturday, so she would leave Saturday morning and wasn’t sure if she would come back or stay at her parents, she also told me that one of her distant friends mom passed away and the visitation was on Wednesday (terrible, obviously go to it), her mom also asked her to help finalize trip plans and for whatever reason required her to be at the her parents’ house.

On Saturday, she ended up back at the apartment late that night after having dinner at her parents, and mentioned that her parents were invited to a BBQ with family friends that they haven’t seen in like15 years on Sunday, but wasn’t sure if she wanted to go, so we talked about what we wanted to do Sunday and made plans, and again she brings up around noon on Sunday that she would like to go and she left around 4pm, returning at 1030pm, again understandable since it’s been so long and just unfortunate timing with everything else.

I understand that this latest example is a bit extreme, but having all this free time pulled away before this long trip got me thinking about how much quality time we spend together, beyond just after work or the few hours before or after these other “obligations”.

A majority of the things that pull her away are things involving her mom, like her mom needs help with something basic that she could accomplish herself, her mom signs her up to help with something that she has no interest in doing, or they haven’t seen each other in a few days so she has a sense of obligation to go spend 20 minutes at dinner with them after they get off work, then they all retreat to separate areas of the house, and all this is despite her telling me she wished she had enough time to just read a book in the apartment or spend more time together.

So I looked at my calendar and figured out it has been 75 days since we attempted a date night, because you guessed it her mom wanted help with something that day and 60 days since we actually accomplished that date night; we also decided 6+ months ago to do Alphabet dates and the date that happened 60 days ago was my turn to plan, so over the last 60 days, it has been her turn to plan the next date. I also realized that since moving into the apartment, she hasn’t spent a full day at the apartment without something taking up most of the day or her just being here in the morning or night and has only cooked one dinner since I moved into the apartment, because she’s just not here to do so or she’s working so I cook.

We’ve talked about these issues multiple times, I actively protest when these other plans come up, express disappoint, and I feel like she needs to set stronger boundaries with what she wants but has a difficult time doing so. She gets extremely overwhelmed, to the point that she breaks down crying because she feels like she can’t make everyone happy and completely ignores her own needs.

While she was gone to the BBQ, I got worked up with all these thoughts and when she got back I  basically told her everything above, that I don’t think one date night over 75 days is sustainable. She replied with she’ll try to be better after she gets back from the trip, but I told her there is no trying, only doing. I know that we love each other and have talked about marriage and our future, but it sucks feeling like I’m just the fallback plan.

So in my mind, the main issue is my girlfriends inability to set boundaries with her mom, should I be concerned nothing will change? Can I approach this issue in a different way?

TL;DR: Girlfriend and I haven’t had a date night in 60 days because any free time we have is overshadowed by other things in her life, despite her verbalizing that she wants to spend more time together.",10,1l1pykc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1pykc/im_32m_frustrated_with_the_lack_of_time_and/
How to politely explain that my partners (22F) parents make me anxious (23M),"We’ve been together coming up 4 years.

Whenever my family has disagreements, there’s never any voice raising or anger. My family tends to disperse into our own areas and then come back whenever the emotions are lower. In bad “fights” it mainly just feels like you have to walk quietly around the house to not disturb anyone else-with passive aggressiveness sprinkled here and there. But the last time my family had an actual fight was probably 5 years ago.

My partners family is the opposite. Raised voices are virtually an every day occurrence. Even whenever there’s not a disagreement, there’s still raised voices and chaos. Screaming fights are I’d say weekly.

It’s never been a problem until recently- we were long distance for the first year and then for two years, she moved in with me and we lived near my family. Last year I got a job across the country and she decided it would be better financially to live back with her family while I live 40 minutes away in my own apartment. 

The most interaction I used to have with her family was around a one week period at most. Now, I see them weekly when I make the drive to see her (I have a car, she doesn’t). She also got a second job, so she used to be able to come over more often to mine, but within the past 3 weeks it’s been me driving to hers.

I’ve realized that her family makes me anxious. Even when tension isn’t high, I find myself subconsciously stressed out wondering when there’s going to be another fight.

Yesterday I was at her place and we were watching tv, and her family came home and casually sat down and watched tv with us. I didn’t realize this til after I left, but my anxiety shot up and I couldn’t sit still once they came back home. I’m always trying to get us to go out and about when her family is home so that I don’t have to worry about that.

She noticed that I was antsy and got upset with me and assumed that I was anxious because we were sitting around doing nothing. It was only later that I put two and two together. I tried explaining to her bluntly that her family makes me anxious, but she took offense to it and defended their actions and said they have done nothing wrong. She says it’s fine and that’s “just how they talk, it doesn’t mean that they’re mad at each other”.
It’s gotten to the point though where I feel a wave of dread driving to her place because I know there’s going to be some issue that her family causes. How can I explain to her that it’s becoming a genuinely bad problem?

TL;DR:
I come from a reserved calmer family- and my partner does not. Verbal arguments are a constant issue. Wasn’t a problem for me until she moved back in with her parents to save money. Now, with me being the one with a car, I see them weekly and have realized that they’re causing me a lot of stress. I tried telling her bluntly that her family makes me stressed out, but she took offense to it and doesn’t seem to see my point of view. How can I explain it to her, especially since this is all she knows?",2,1l1p8ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1p8ac/how_to_politely_explain_that_my_partners_22f/
"M29 and F34 having constant fights over family issues and ex, how to approach situation better?","TL;DR -> My girlfriend(34) and I(29) together for \~5 months have been fighting for the last two weeks due to exes and family issues. We almost broke off once because we thought we were not compatible, but we decided to try again. I am looking for advice on how to approach the situation better and get my relationship back on track. My outcome is for us to get our relationship back on track with minimum friction.  
Context(reposting again since the last one got deleted due to missing TL; DR)—We met last December at an event, decided to talk, and went on a date in early January. The first date felt terrific, and things were going quite well, so we started an exclusive relationship in February.

We talked about our past relationships and our families. We had fights a couple of times, but nothing out of the ordinary. We have a long distance, so we meet and go on vacation every week in Asia. Since both of us earn good money, we are able to meet every month.

Issues started mid-month when we began discussing marriage, like introducing families. She doesn‘t want me to meet her family because they might not like me and she doesn't have a good relationship with them. I didn’t push for it, since I respected her decision. I want her to meet my family, but the issue is that this topic becomes quite touchy. Somehow, it feels like a task that must be done for her, like she would ask how many times she needs to meet, how many times she needs to call them, etc. Family is important to me, and she’s my priority, too, so I want to make sure we feel comfortable with each other. But I feel like im maybe forcing her to meet my family? The issue is we discussed engagement and marriage, and I can't get married without introducing her to my family. But somehow I get questions like, if some argument happens, who would you choose? I told her I would choose her, and then we could discuss what we could have. But the question that bothers me is when she asked who I would choose if my mom asked me to choose between my mom and her. I argue that she will be part of the family, so we don’t choose one over another. If there is conflict we solve it. But this is a significant reason for fights almost every other day. Then her ex messages her, which I am not comfortable with. She asked her ex why he gave up on her, and his reply upset her because somehow his mother told him not to leave his wife for her. I was upset why she asked this question, etc, but she got upset that I would do the same. I do bring up the topic of exes constantly, maybe I shouldn’t, but I get insecure somehow, perhaps it's because of my past relationship, where I got cheated on.

Another source of the fight is that we planned to have a vacation with my family, but it didn’t go according to plan because of location changes. Still, I said I am sorry for the mess with booking etc but she called them fucking morons, I get she’s angry but i don’t get why name calling. So, I cancelled the trip and decided to get her on a call with my family a couple of times before introducing them f2f, so things are not too overwhelming for everyone.

I do agree I have communication problem, for example if I know something is going to lead to a fight, I will still tell her because i don't want to hide anything, example on location change for visit for my family I kinda could have managed situation better, by just telling her one location.

I sometimes don’t understand what I am doing wrong. Is there something I should do better to fix our relationship? I just don‘t want to end things because I love her a lot, and I promised to marry her(I do want to). But I also don’t want fights. So I want to know how I should approach the situation better",1,1l1ox08,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1ox08/m29_and_f34_having_constant_fights_over_family/
My [26F] MIL [50F] keeps trying to set up dinners with my standoffish family,"My partner [25M] and I started dating right before the height of the pandemic, and with all of the social distancing our families never met for quite a while. After the social distancing rules lifted, we still didn’t end up planning anything right away. We finally moved in together last fall, and around that same time my MIL kept mentioning she wanted to bring the families together. She is a very social person, the type to host a fancy dinner just because without any need for a special occasion. My family is a lot more socially awkward and we tend to keep gatherings limited to social occasions or at least have there be a reason for getting together. 

On our move-in day we had both families (my parents and his parents) come help out and that was when they met for the first time and spent the day together. We also had dinner later that evening and overall it was a nice day because my socially awkward parents were able to keep their hands busy but we still got everyone to meet. 

Now my MIL is saying it felt like a big rush and she wants to have a proper sit-down dinner with my parents and my siblings. I’m not sure what to say because she keeps moving the goalpost and increasing her expectations, but to be quite honest I have a very practical non-sentimental relationship with my siblings and they’re not the type to drive somewhere just to sit down to dinner with MY in-laws. For reference my brother didn’t come to my birthday because I live 50 minutes from him and he didn’t want to make the drive. My MIL lives over an hour from him and he DEFINITELY would not make that drive, or if he did he’d probably hate me for it. 

My partner and I are planning to host an engagement or elopement party next summer, and at that point we’ll be bringing everyone together. 

How do I temper expectations with my MIL around these sorts of social expectations? I don’t feel like getting into the weeds about my family dynamic but I guess I also owe her an explanation. 

Tl;dr - My MIL wants to set up social gatherings with my family but I only see them on special occasions and I don’t have a super  close relationship with my siblings and I want to shut down this conversation.

How to ask boyfriend 30M not to buy gifts for me 24F,"TL;DR I (24F) wants to ask my boyfriend (30M) to stop buying me gifts, especially with my birthday coming up, because it makes me uncomfortable due to past trauma and financial inequality in the relationship. While I appreciates the thought, I feel guilty that I can’t reciprocate and fear that he might overspend. I value quality time over material gifts and I'm seeking advice on how to communicate this without seeming ungrateful or insecure.



I, 24 F, ask my boyfriend, 30 M, not to buy me gifts. We've talked for four months before getting together. Currently we have been together for 5 months. We don't live together. 

 I grew up in a family where they would throw back the things that they bought you back in your face and I just hated receiving gifts since then. I also have trouble asking for money when I need it because I don't want to seem like I'm with him for money. 

Plus financially I'm not I'm the best position to buy gifts and I always feel bad when he buys me something. I feel bad when he takes me out. I have covered a meal once and a while but it's nowhere near how much he has spent. 

His financials are better than mine but he has more expenses to pay. My boyfriend also has expensive taste too and I know he would go over board, if I don't ask him to stop. I cherish the gifts he gives me dearly. But with my birthday coming up I've already warned him not to buy anything but I have a feeling he will. All I want is just his time. And Ive expressed that to him. But I really don't want him to spend anymore money. 

I know I sound insecure and probably childish but I just want to be with him for him. I just don't understand why he has to spend so much sometimes. 

I'm at a lost. Any advice? ",0,1l1odod,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1odod/how_to_ask_boyfriend_30m_not_to_buy_gifts_for_me/
What do I (17M) do about my friend (17M) who seems to have blocked me?,"So I have a friend and we've been pretty close since we were maybe around 7-8 years old. We used to hang out a lot, but then I moved and we started hanging out a bit less but we still frequently played video games and we also made sure to meet up from time to time. However lately, a year or two back, he started becoming worse at responding to my texts, usually taking quite a while, saying that he was very busy with school which I could understand but once he did respond, he was usually enthusiastic and happy to talk or plan activities. One time however, he didn't respond for a very long time. At a point, I was in the area because I was seeing another friend who lived nearby. I saw him at the store and asked if he'd seen the message and he sounded genuinely surprised, showed him that he hadn't gotten any message in his phone. It appeared that he had accidentally blocked me so he unblocked me and I went on with my day. He actually started getting better at responding to my messages. We even had a sleepover quite recently and I felt that we were both having really fun during the sleepover and I didn't feel any signs that he would dislike hanging out with me. But then, just a month or so after the sleepover, I tried to call him and it immediately went to voicemail. I tried to message him but didn't get an answer. I tried to contact him through discord as well in case he'd accidentally blocked me, but again, no answer. I kept calling him every now and then to check if it would still immediately go to voicemail, and it still did. Even now, I am about to have my 18th birthday and I've invited all of my close friends. Just to make sure he actually got the invitation, I sent it physically to his mailbox. But it's been a week or two since I sent it and no answer. My calls still go to voicemail, my messages remain unanswered and he hasn't visibly been online on discord for a long time.

I just don't understand what could've happened. There was nothing bad that happened between us, no argument, no anything. It was just a sleepover, we both had a lot of fun, we kept chatting after the sleepover, and then suddenly, boom, blocked.

I just don't really know what to do.

TL:DR, My friend of about 10 years seems to have blocked me and I have no idea what caused it as we had a sleepover and seemed to have a lot of fun about a month before.

What should I (18m) do about my subconscious distancing that has been happening with my parents (50s)?,"
My parents have always been very supportive of me and went above and beyond in trying to make my life better and providing for me, which I always have and always will appreciate. I’ll never act like they neglect me or anything like that, because in that regard they’ve done a great job.

However, ever since I was probably around 8 years old, I remember that I started to become secretive for some reason. I don’t remember any events that directly started it, i just began to distance myself from them for what felt like no reason. Whenever they asked me how my day was, I just said “good” and hoped to avoid any conversation after that. That habit has persisted to the present day, as I still don’t like talking about how my day went with them.

As I got older, they began to become much more strict about my schoolwork and grades, and with time the pressure became so huge I felt like there was always a cloud of just misery looming over me the entirety of the school year. By the time I was 13 I basically had depression for months straight at a time.

I despised school and I despised how my parents saw it as basically the only important factor in my life and blamed me for any grade that wasn’t good enough even if I tried. I barely slept at night because it felt like the only time I was free from that train of thought, so I would just sit on my phone or let all my emotions out because I didn’t feel like I was even allowed to during the day.

In high school it all just got worse. They started to become overprotective with how I spend my time outside of school, not just be demanding in my academic performance. Like in middle school I was allowed to go anywhere and do anything with my friends, but now all of a sudden I’m probably doing bad things and they need to hover over me. School was getting harder and harder and so was their enforcement of trying to make me do good.

This past senior year was the low point. Every day I was miserable waking up knowing that they’re both home and I’ll have to listen to them fight and yell at each other all day. Knowing that every 5 minutes they’re gonna call me out of my room to yell at me about a scholarship or tell me that I’m not allowed to go somewhere with my friends because it’s “dangerous” or “I need to focus on school”. My grades were slipping because I had no energy or motivation and was completely depressed every single day.

Now that the school year is over, I’ve been having a lot less problems with them, but they told me today how it feels like I avoid them and hide things from them and it feels like I don’t like them. It never even crossed my mind, but I see where they’re coming from. For the last ten years I’ve been like this. I never tell them how my day was. I never go up to them in public when I can instead just be around my friends. They say it feels like I ignore them. I’m not even mad at them, I had no conscious decision in avoiding them like that, but I have to admit I do it. Maybe it just comes down to how badly I want to be able to live in my own. How I hate seeing them EVERY SINGLE DAY no matter what, they’re always here, yelling at each other, blaming me for something, or making me feel like I can’t be myself when they’re in the same house as me for some reason. I just hide in my room and wait until they go to bed so I can be happy again. Why am I like this? What should I do?

TL:DR- my parents are hurt by how it feels like I avoid them or ignore them, especially in public. I never really noticed how much I did it, but now I feel guilty, despite the fact that over the years I have had my problems with them and have naturally wanted more space. I feel like maybe I’m being unfair, and while it was only subconsciously that I wasn’t talking to them, I just feel wrong for it. I do care about them and appreciate them, but I’m just so tired of having to be basically attached at the hip with them especially with how the last few years have gone.",5,1l1ltws,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1ltws/what_should_i_18m_do_about_my_subconscious/
I (31F) am thinking of breaking off my engagement to fiance (32M).,"I (31F) am thinking of breaking off my engagement to fiance (32M). We had a whirlwind romance which could definitely be blamed for the fact that we got engaged the day of our 1 year anniversary (I told so many people “when you know, you know!” 🥴). It’s now 8 months later and I have completely hit a roadblock. He is fully aware of the internal struggle I’ve been having and I’ve given him several outs but he insists that we’ll work through it together (he’s so nice 😭). Leading up to the engagement I had a few freak outs about the commitment but when he actually proposed I felt like I was being silly about it given our compatibility and I happily said yes. We have lived together for almost a year now and he is the perfect roommate: cleans up after himself, cooks, contributes to chores. He is always doing acts of service for me which is rare in my experience (my exes weren’t total losers…just not as generous). We have the same life goals, worldview, and values. We love the same music, movies, and have the same humor. I am terrified I will never find someone as compatible as him. I feel like I hit the jackpot…on paper. But I just feel trapped and no matter what I do I can’t seem to overcome it. Our families and friends think we are crazy in love so I know this would come as a major shock to everyone. To complicate things neither of us has family nearby so I have no idea how I would handle moving out. We still have 6 months left on the lease and are both working pretty middle-of-the-road jobs (he’s in IT, I’m a teacher). 

And now to be a bad person. I sometimes look at him and can only see flaws. I think overall he’s handsome but I wasn’t instantly attracted to him. Sometimes I’m quite take by how cute he is and other times I scrutinize pictures to figure out if I'm really attracted. The sex is …meh. He is very timid about it and cannot seem to directly initiate even after several conversations about how I would like to feel desired (I initiate 75% of the time…the other 25% is him just looking at me and raising his eyebrows suggestively which is not a turn-on for me and I usually call it out). Once we start it’s fine and I do get off…but it’s the same exact thing every time. When I try to talk dirty he just stays silent even though outside of sex he says he loves it. We have had many conversations about it and he’s always excited to “spice things up” but then doesn’t put anything into action. He also struggles with ED and will not get help for it (I’ve suggested therapy so many times). I have been super patient about this and always redirect to making out to try and help him (he says distraction is best)- I’ve never shamed him. I just can’t imagine this being how our sex life STARTS in marriage. 

I have almost pulled the plug so many times. But I look at him and still feel so much love. And I laugh so hard with him- none of my previous partners have matched my banter in the same way. Watching him sleep just squeezes my heart and makes me want to protect him. I already know the comments will tear me up for “leading him on” or some variant and there won’t be anything worse than what I think about myself already. All I can say in my defense is that I’ve been entirely open with him about my feelings the entire time and he has chosen to stay on the chance that I’ll “get better.” I still feel like a terrible partner. I do take good care of him with lots of home-cooked meals, housework, surprise gifts and experiences. I took him on a surprise trip to Disney to celebrate a promotion just last month (ok that sounded stupid once I typed it out, but I am leaving it anyways…and he’s a big Disney fan while I’m a little meh so it wasn’t for me). I just don’t know what I can try anymore to get that loving feeling back. I want it to work so bad as it’s “perfect on paper” and I was sooooo in love (I know…honeymoon phase) but I feel myself checking out more and more every day. I have avoidant tendencies and lean way too hard into independence- I have been in therapy for months to work on this, but at this point it feels like it goes beyond that to some real issues. Any similar stories or advice welcome as I navigate the fork-in-the-road. How do I make the decision to end a relationship that seems so compatible? Can I revive it?

How to show my boyfriend that I am worth it?,"Since I translated this using Google Translate, I apologize in advance if there are any language errors.
Hi, something happened between my boyfriend and I recently and I still can't get over it. I wanted to get a different cultural perspective on my situation so I created this account.

Beforehand I am 18 year old guy and my boyfriend is also still 18. We have been dating for about 3 months now.

Our school participated in an exchange program where our school in East Asia exchanged 10 students with another school in North America for two weeks.
Our school's mission was to have one of the exchange students join the friend group, which we did. The exchange student asked us if we were dating, after I asked my boyfriend if we could hold hands but he said that we were not. I don't know why he said that but we are. If we weren't, I wouldn't have done intimate things with him, you know?
For background, my boyfriend is not Chinese but he has lived here for about four years and we have been friends. When I said I didn't understand why he said that, our exchange student told me that it was just normal behavior for Western men.

Now I want to ask others how I can make my boyfriend see I am worthy of being with him.
I would prefer to get western insights because I want to understand my boyfriend better by using an approach in a typical western way.

Should I confront my girlfriend about chatting with another guy?,"
I (20M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (20F) for more than a year, and we truly care about each other. We’re in a long-distance relationship during the week because of university, but we see each other on weekends and are emotionally close.

Lately, I’ve been feeling a little off due to something I noticed. There’s this one guy she chats with online—nothing explicitly wrong from what I can tell, but I can’t shake the feeling that she hides that interaction when I’m around. For example, she won’t open his messages in front of me or skips them quickly. She’s open with most of her chats, except this one. She just once said that he texted her because of her art profile. Yesterday i saw that he reacted with 😍 to the story of her new personal post and she replied with 🤍🤍🤍that triggers a little jealousy and insecurity in me, especially because I don’t have a big social circle outside of her.

I haven’t confronted her about it yet, because I don’t want to seem controlling or toxic. She had a traumatic relationship before, and I’m doing my best not to repeat that kind of pressure. But at the same time, I’m wondering if I’m ignoring a potential red flag.

She shows she loves me: sends memes, checks in with how I’m feeling, apologizes when she overreacts. So this might just be me overthinking, We hug and kiss and spend quality time together.

Do you think I should bring it up and how? Or am I being overly insecure?

"How do I create healthy distance from my BF’s sister after a fallout, while still being kind and respectful?","I’m a woman in my mid-20s, dating a man in his early 30s. His sister is in her mid-30s. A few months ago, she and I had a fallout — we’d grown close over the past year. At a family event, she raised her voice at me (which is a trigger for me), and I shut down. When she asked if I was ignoring her, I said yes, which upset her more. I tried to apologize privately (knowing she doesn’t like being ignored), but the conversation didn’t go well. She said she wasn’t raising her voice, and I felt talked over and dismissed.

Later that night, she brought it up again and said she was sorry “for how I felt,” but I felt small and a bit cornered. I apologized for my part and didn’t really want to revisit it again. I pulled back for a while, overwhelmed with the situation and life in general. She eventually called, and we had a full conversation where we both apologized and moved on. Since then, she hasn’t brought anything up again, and we’ve been able to hang out (sometimes a little awkward, but good overall). We went from talking daily to only when we see each other, which honestly feels more comfortable and less emotionally loaded for me. For background, I don’t have much closeee friends. 

The problem is, my boyfriend has made comments about how I “cut people off easily.” I haven’t fully shared how I felt during all of that, partly because I didn’t want to put him in the middle or risk creating a wedge between him and his sister. That’s the last thing I want. But he’s been making little comments or questions (which I think come from a good place) like, “Do you not want to go because she’ll be there?” — even though I’ve moved on and haven’t said anything about her.

I brought it up with my bf and asked how he felt and if this had an effect on our relationship and he basically said no. I know his sister has brought it up with him since then but he doesn’t talk about it and honestly, I don’t ask. Now I’m wondering, should I also check in with her again just to clear the air one more time — even though we already hashed it out and she hasn’t brought anything else up to me?

I don’t want to reopen old wounds, but I also don’t want to let silence create assumptions.

TL;DR:
I (mid-20s F) had a fallout with my BF’s (early 30s M) sister (mid-30s F). We talked and made peace, and she hasn’t brought up anything since. I’ve kept a bit of distance, which feels better for me.

I (47M) frustrated by wife (40F) and wondering if I can keep going,"Myself and my wife have had a lot of conflict in the past few years. She is a good and kind person, a great mother to our children, and does a lot for our family.

A few years ago I sold some property and paid off our mortgage. I took six months off. This was elating for me. I don’t hate my job, as such, but I have always wanted options in my life (to work when I want to, see the world, etc).

But my wife wanted to upgrade our home. I tried to “sell” the idea of optionality (without a mortgage we have more choices - we could work more discretionally, she could yoga more, we could both spend more time with the kids). There were not specific goals, just a general idea that I was presenting. But this didn’t land and so I convinced myself to go along with it.

In anticipation of the increased financial burden I took a job - a stressful one, as it turns out. It is not guaranteed to succeed. I’m not too happy that I felt like I had to do this.

My wife works (she really is a contributor) and I indicated to her that if we did this it wouldn’t just cost us money but time. She needed to step up to make this work.

Now we’re in the new place and we’re going backwards. I’m super stressed and my wife keeps saying that she’ll work more but it’s not materialising. Deep down I don’t want her to work more - but I (we) need her to. It’s just the reality that we signed up for.

I find myself starting to resent her. I feel like she pushed this without fully understanding the repercussions. I look back at the life of relative freedom that we could have had and I am angry. The fact that I don’t see her living up to her end of the bargain has made me frustrated and we fight. If I try to bring up budgeting it gets very emotional and defensive.

I need advice on finding a way to not put this on her and stop being so angered by it.

TL/DR: my wife and I were free and clear, she pushed for a house upgrade, we’re going backwards now and I feel like she’s not pulling her weight. It’s making us fight.",145,1l1gj46,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1gj46/i_47m_frustrated_by_wife_40f_and_wondering_if_i/
My (35F) parents (70s) moved into my one-bedroom apartment and it is destroying my mental health.,"I am a 35-year-old woman. I have had some successes in life. I have traveled a lot, I am pursuing a PhD, and I have worked across different sectors. But right now I am in a difficult place. I was laid off from my last full-time job and have been doing small contract gigs while applying for work and trying to finish my graduate program.
I have not had a real break since 2015 and I am extremely burnt out. I am also single and currently living in a one-bedroom apartment that my dad leases for tax residency purposes. My parents usually live abroad but they let me stay here while I get back on my feet.
In March 2025, both of my parents moved into the apartment with me. They are in their 70s and have serious medical needs. I told them this would be hard for me, especially while I am trying to finish my PhD and apply for jobs. They said it would be temporary, but they have now been here for months, but will leave at the end of June. The apartment is under 400 square feet. It is not meant for three adults, two of whom have a lot of belongings and ongoing care needs. My mom constantly complains about the mess but does not acknowledge the sheer impracticality of the situation. She blames me for the clutter and accuses me of being lazy, selfish, and emotionally unavailable. Meanwhile, I am working on multiple small jobs, trying to write, and going through interviews. It feels like nothing I do is ever enough.
My parents have always been critical, but in the past few years it has intensified. They constantly bring up milestones I have not met. I am single. I do not own property. I have been financially unstable since 2024. They compare me to people my age who are married, have homes, or make more money. The message is that I have failed in life and that it is my fault. Lately the criticism has turned more aggressive, especially about my relationship status. I once turned down a few arranged marriage style set ups and my mom cried and brought up her cancer diagnosis as a way to try push me into the process of it. She was baffled I didn’t even want to meet that guy and essentially said it’s the only way forward for me. I date in my own a lot but I have not found my person and they used this to push me new narratives of inadequacy. They suggest that my being single is proof that something is deeply wrong with me, like I’m some kind of failed eugenics project.

This week I finally tried to say something. I calmly told my parents that their moving in has made it very difficult for me to function and that I have been extremely unhappy. My mom exploded. After our argument, she got on the phone with my cousin and said the following in Bengali:
“I hope she does not get a husband, and even if she does, he will kick her out. She is sure to suffer in any relationship, even if there is love.” The phrasing in Bengali very clearly implied domestic violence. The way she said it, the ""kicking out"" was not figurative. She was saying I would deserve that kind of treatment. That even if someone loved me, I would make them hate me. That I was fundamentally defective, and something in me brings out the bad in otherwise good and loving people. 

Later, when I told her how hurtful this was, she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then she got angry again and accused me of being arrogant and ungrateful. She said I had ""grown too big for my britches"" and that she would ""cut me down."" She also ""joked"" about disinheriting me.

I feel like I am going crazy. I cannot trust anything. I am constantly being hurt, then told I imagined it or deserved it. My mother will go from saying terrifying things to suddenly acting normal and asking what I want for dinner. The switch is so fast that it makes me doubt my own memory and perception.

There is something else I need to mention. When I was about 11 or 12, I had a journal I kept private. My mom asked to see it. I refused. I remember standing my ground. She looked at me and said:
“I see how strong your no is. If you are ever taken advantage of, I will know on some level you consented.”
That memory has never left me. It was not a joke. It was not an offhand comment. I was a child setting a boundary, and she responded by threatening my sense of bodily autonomy and blaming me in advance for any potential future harm. I have spoken to my therapist about it and she suggested my mom might have Borderline Personality Disorder. But diagnosis aside, I feel lost. I do not know what to do anymore.

I feel guilty. My parents are aging and unwell. They have supported me financially at times, including giving me this place to stay. But their behavior is affecting my mental health so much that I am beginning to shut down. I feel like I will never build a life for myself if I stay stuck in this dynamic.

I am tired. I am ashamed. I feel worthless and angry and scared. I have no idea what to do next.

My questions:
What are some realistic steps I can take to set boundaries when I do not control the housing situation?
Am I overreacting or seeing this too emotionally? I honestly do not know anymore.
How do I protect myself emotionally while still trying to survive this phase of my life?

TL;DR: I am a 35-year-old woman trying to finish a PhD and job hunt after a layoff. My aging parents moved into my small one-bedroom apartment despite my objections. My mom is emotionally and verbally abusive, telling relatives I deserve mistreatment and blaming me for being single and unsuccessful. I feel like I am going crazy from the gaslighting, cruelty, and lack of space. I need help figuring out how to set boundaries and survive this dynamic.

Feeling smothered,"Hi all. Advice needed please.

I '55M' have been with a lady '57F' for about six weeks. She's an absolute beautiful person, with a lovely soul.
But, for the last two weeks or more I'm being constantly lovebombed. I feel I'm being smothered. Always professing her love for me, bringing me food all the time.
And the texts...so many.
For instance. I have mental health problems and when I have a bad turn, which I'm in the middle of right now, I just want to be alone. No contact with anyone and left to myself. We have talked about it and she agreed, but, all she does is text me over and over. She actually came to my house yesterday with food and started crying, saying this is how her last relationship went. She was being ignored etc, even though she agreed to give me space to sort myself out.

I don't want to end things as she really is amazing and I know if I do it will break her heart.

Also, I forgot to mention, she lives next door but one in my cul-de-sac and I have to walk past her house every time I go out..

So, basically, how do I approach her and what can I say?

His reaction was calm and all, everything felt fine, then in the evening while we were at my place he tells me he was going to be in the mall where me and my friends were gonna hang to “do his stuff” and keep check on me to make sure i was gonna be alright. Sweet and all he wants to make sure im fine, but it made me SO uneasy… im scared to hurt him by telling him that i felt like i had no freedom, but its little to say that its clearly like that if thats what he does when i go out, luckily my friend delayed of like 2 hours and he wont be there.. sooo what do i do? i dont want to be mean with him since he always gives his best to make me happy and everything but i feel like THAT crossed the line

How can i be less controlling with my gf and be more chill (15m),"How do i be more chill with my gf and less controlling? (15m)

TL;DR how can i be less controlling and less threatened about a guy that doesn’t want her and i know she would never cheat on me?

 myself and my girlfriend, both 15, have been dating for 8 months. we’ve been going smooth and i think this is the one!! we’re in seperate classes in school. and sometimes her girl mates aren’t there so she has to sit by herself. a lot of the time this one guy (who bullied tf out of me for a year) thinks they’re best mates and tries to sit with her. i’ve asked her to ignore him and not interact with him. but i see on her snap memories that she’s talking to him and shit in class? it makes me so upset when she does that. i’ve asked her to seriously ignore him. i’m not threatened by him it’s just i hatec that guy so much and i don’t want him near her bc i know he’ll try and ruin us. 

that’s not the thing i need help with. there’s this other guy (i’m a very very jealous bf) and he and her get along. which already pisses me off. he sits next to her in class and is nice and he seems like he doesn’t want her or anything. i’m don’t have a huge problem with him, for instance this guy i mentioned before who used to bully me, he apparently was saying mean shit about me and the other guy stood up for me and my gf. which kind of shed a new light like, maybe he isn’t so bad. i’ve talked to my gf about him and she says she won’t talk to him outside of school or message him but she doesn’t want him blocked on insta nc he had no fiends and she doesn’t wanna be mean. he seems nice and i really just want to be more chill about him becuase me and my gf have had talks abt us in the past and she said i need to be more chill in general. how can i try and be more chill with her sitting with him etc. she would never cheat and i trust her, i guess it’s that i don’t trust him and i do feel a bit threatened by him and very jealous aswell. how can i be more chill? she also called him “a mate” which honestly infuriated me. we’ve had talks before and have both agreed no girl mates for me no guy mates for her. idk why he’s special? i think that’s the thing i’m threatened by like why is he special yk?

idk i’m kind of ranting atp so please if u can share some advice that would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1l1fecu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1fecu/how_can_i_be_less_controlling_with_my_gf_and_be/
My boyfriend (18M) barely makes time for me (23F) anymore,"I (23F) have been dating this guy (18M) for a while now and things started out really great. He used to be super attentive, always texting, calling, wanting to hang out, planning cute little dates. But now it feels like I’m the only one putting in effort.

He still talks to me, but it’s usually quick replies, or just sending memes. He takes ages to respond to messages, even though I can see he’s active on social media. When I ask if he wants to do something, he either says he’s tired, busy, or just kind of shrugs it off.

I’ve tried asking if something’s wrong, but he always says he’s fine. I don’t want to be clingy or overthink it, but I’m starting to feel kind of ignored. Like I’m not a priority anymore.

Is this just how some people are once the “honeymoon phase” ends, or is it a sign he’s losing interest?

Next night he goes and says he'll be back at midnight at the latest. At around 12:30 am I text him and ask him why he didn't come home early like he said and he goes off about how he works hard and pays the bills and he's not doing anything wrong and the ""buddies"" he met at the casino 2 weeks ago have ladies that dont act how I act and that I am always fighting and starting arguments.

"I (21F) am afraid my new relationship (20M) is already doomed, what should I do?","My boyfriend got out of a long-term, live-in relationship only about two months before we started seeing each other. From the start, he told me he hadn’t fully processed the breakup and didn’t want anything serious yet. I told him I was okay with that because I’d liked him for so long and was afraid of losing the chance to be with him.

We made things official after a month, and right after that, summer break started and we became long-distance. Since then, he hasn’t messaged me much and been distant (he said he’s really busy and warned me he’s not good at long distance) and spending a lot of time with a close female friend he used to have mutual romantic feelings for. I told him how I felt about this and he said I didn’t need to worry and they’re just friends now, but they moved out to our college town together and are practically inseparable. It makes me feel incredibly insecure.

The relationship is still new (we haven’t even said “I love you” yet), and I’m scared to be honest about how unhappy I feel. I promised I wouldn’t pressure him or ask for too much, but I’m in agony. Even though we’re technically together, I still feel like I’m chasing after him — like I’m constantly worried he’ll leave me for someone else.

I don’t know if I’m being irrational, self-sabotaging, or if my gut is trying to warn me. I have a history of being cheated on and struggle with CPTSD and bipolar disorder, so I don’t fully trust my judgment. I don’t want to ruin this relationship, but I also don’t know if it’s already slipping away and I should just let go before I get hurt again.
What should I do? I adore the guy and I’m serious about wanting to be with him, but I’m afraid that the situation is doomed and inevitably going to end with him hurting me.

TLDR: My boyfriend started dating me shortly after a long-term breakup. We became official then went long-distance, and now he’s emotionally distant and very close to a girl he used to like. I feel insecure, scared, and unsure whether I’m overreacting or if the relationship is already falling apart.

Is this normal?,"Hey guys, I really need help and just need to talk to people. I have social anxiety disorder and not really any friends so you are my last resort. My wife F32 and I M33 we are both in our early 30s, married for 3 and together for more than 5 years. I moved to the city she lived many years ago and recently started my dream job right here.

Currently she is visiting her family in her home country for two weeks (she can work remote from there). Yesterday we had a phone talk which ended in a huge fight. She proposed an idea about a trip (we are both avid travelers). However, this once again involved her mom. The plan suggested her mom visits us and then the three of us go somewhere for two days on the weekend and then I go home (I am still on my trial period and cannot get any vacation obviously) and then she and her mother will continue that. I did not really like that plan. I love travelling alone or with my wife, but not with my mother-in-law. She has no money and everything is paid for her. Meanwhile, we are low on money ourselves. There is a language barrier (I am learning my wife’s native language but I’m still at intermediate level) and for me it’s not a holiday but rather exhausting every time. We talked about this many times before. Bear in mind, we already took trips with my wife and my mother-in-law together this year (one week and four days on another occasion). My wife also spent another week with my mother-in-law at another place and I stayed at home, they have another week-long trip coming up and we planned to spend the Christmas holidays and her family’s. I actually spent more time with her mother-in-law than with my own family.

As this is a controversial topic, I tried to avoid it. But she kept pushing me to say why I do not like her travel idea. I said ok I can tell you but you have to promise me not to get mad, to which she agreed. I told her that I don’t really like to travel with her mom because for me it’s just exhausting. I told her this many times before. My wife then completely exploded. She said I cannot disrespect her family like this. Her family was there first and I came afterwards. If she had to decide between me and her mother, her mother will always come first. She said I am not part of the family anymore and she wants a divorce. For context, I can’t really take this seriously because she said this like fifty to a hundred times before, i.e. every time we had a fight respectively every time I disagreed on something or asserted another opinion.
Plus, every time we have a fight I like to discuss it or find a compromise. She, however, prefers the silent treatment. If I bring up some (in my opinion) valid points, she always says she does not want to talk anymore and goes stonewalling. She also never apologises afterwards. I also asked her what about promising that she won’t get mad if I raise my opinion. She said „I changed my mind now.“

Now as a result of this fight she blocked me on WhatsApp (this she already did many, many times). As she is in another country, I have no way of physically reaching out to her and don’t know if she will communicate with me again tomorrow or in two weeks, who knows.

I am having a panic attack. This conflict is unresolved, I am all alone, I should focus on my job but my heart is racing like crazy. Please advice.

Boyfriends apartment is dusgustingg,"I'm in a good realationship (about 6 months) with my boyfriend (M35) but his apartment (rented for almost10 years) is very much under-maintaned.

There's a lot of stuff that's actually the land ladys and he doesn't want/use just taking up space (example: a shelf full of young adults books), his toilet is pretty disgusting, the shower area filled with half used bottles and toothpaste stains, the kitchen- only 2 usable shelves, the rest is filled with just stuff. (empty bags, half empty old tea boxes..) He's healthy, not a hoarder- just a high-tech live-alone guy (Most of his week he's at work, so he usually eats there.)

He kind of cleans around things, so it's not like he doesn't clean at all- the floor is usually clean, he'll change the sheets now and then, he does his laundry and everything. It's just not so nice to be at his APT.

I have my own home so I keep it to my own standarts, but we live like 2.5 hours away so it's not really an option to not sleep at his place (also I like slumber partys with him, you know?)

So the question is.... What to do? I know he's open to advice and to criticism, but obviously he's living this way for a while so it doesn't bug him. It bugs ME but I don't want to start cleaning for him (maybe we can clean together?) but I also have NO IDEA where to start. Should I maybe offer some proffesional help, just to get his place to baseline? Do I need to offer to pay for the Proffesional help? Should I make a list of ckeaning supplies I can't find so we can start? (I see no toilet detergant, no extra dish washing sponge- and the current one is actually growing moss....)

i love him deeply but his family has made me feel excluded and unwelcome. what do i do?,"I’m 18F, and my boyfriend is 19M. We’ve been dating for a year but have known each other for three. This relationship has been the best I could’ve asked for — he loves me deeply, supports me, and I genuinely see a future with him.

I don’t have a good relationship with my parents due to past abuse and left home at 17. I’ve lived with my grandparents since and support myself completely. Because of my past, yelling or conflict is very triggering to me.

The issue is with his family. I’ve never felt fully welcomed. His mom is hot and cold, and I had a draining experience working for her early in the relationship. I also don’t get along with his sister-in-law, and his mom has made comments that it’s my fault and I should “try harder.” I’ve always felt watched or judged, especially since I don’t have a stable family background.

About four weeks ago, his dad screamed at me over not using a napkin, cursed at me, and basically kicked me out. It triggered me so badly I was shaking and crying. I haven’t been back to his house since. My boyfriend can’t come over due to my grandparents’ rules, so this has created a lot of emotional distance between us.

We’ve been talking for hours, crying in parking lots, trying to figure out how to move forward. I reached out to his mom to have a conversation. We met at a restaurant, and instead of listening to my feelings, she listed everything I’ve done wrong, said I can’t be treated like family since we’re not married, and questioned our relationship. I felt dismissed and blamed.

Now, she’s “okay” with me coming over again — but only once a week, only in their basement, and I must leave by 11 PM. I’m hurt and confused. I love my boyfriend so much and know he loves me too, but I’m not sure how to keep this going when I feel so unwelcome and emotionally drained by his family. I just scheduled an appointment with my therapist to start unpacking everything.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? How do I balance protecting myself while holding onto a relationship that means the world to me?

(UPDATE) How do I (47M) tell my boyfriend (35M) that I'm a virgin?,"Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp

Hey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.

Summary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.

I left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.

We had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.

I have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.

Once I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.

I feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.

I have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!

TL;DR; self sabotage,"Me F27 and girlfriend F23 have been together for 3 years. I recently have started self sabotaging because a ring is on the way. There was a girl at work that I met (F 20) that I started to become close with. We started to confide in each other and basically, bond over stressors in our own relationships. Instead of telling my partner, I told this other female things I should’ve communicated with my partner. I would even meet up with this girl to talk about things after work and not tell my person. 
Nothing physical EVER happened, nor did I want it to. My partner started to catch onto this girl and didn’t want me talking to her.  I may have emotionally tried to see if I could catch feelings for someone else other than my partner (which didn’t happen and made me realize I only want my partner) and told a friend how I’ve been feeling and she told my partner. My partner is mortified and I don’t blame her one bit. 
I feel horrible and I don’t want to lose her. The ring was getting closer to being here (I had it customized on Etsy) and I freaked out, literally self sabotaging and breaking her trust. I have trauma with marriage because of my parents and I know that’s why I did what I did.

My girlfriend lied to me,"My girlfriend (25) and I (23) are in a serious relationship, we live together and have been very happy for the entirety of the time we’ve been together (about 1 months into living together and 1.5 years into being in a relationship). 

We haven’t ever had any full arguments and have been almost entirely very content with each other. However last night she had a friend come stay as they had plans to go for some relaxed drinks at a pub/bar. She’d always had casual drinks planned when we talked about it through the week prior. Her friend lives about 1.5 hours away and usually spends the night if she comes here. I don’t usually like drinking but I found it weird as she usually asks if I want to come with but not this time. Her friend gets here at 7pm, they leave the house at around 9pm. 

I walk them up to the bar as it’s 5 minutes (important) from our house and I had to go into the grocery shop next door so I say goodbye to them both there. I go home and leave them to it without messaging because I don’t want to be a bother and my girlfriend texts at about 10:30pm saying they’re still at the same bar. We exchange a couple of texts and I fall asleep with her last text to me being at 12:45am. I wake up randomly at about 2:30am and due to injury couldn’t get back to sleep so I go on my phone for a while as she’s still not in. I hear them come in at about 3:15am (most pubs here close at 11/12am generally with 1am being the latest). They stay downstairs for a while talking and my girlfriend comes up after a while and sleeps as far away as possible, I can tell it takes her a while to fall asleep which is uncharacteristic. Also uncharacteristic as she usually has to cuddle me for her to fall asleep. In the morning, she makes no mention of where she went and so I don’t ask any questions. I am familiar with the pub she went to and it is fairly upmarket and wouldn’t have doors open past 1am latest from what I know if there’s no events on. 

The next day I don’t mention anything and that night she says randomly “we just stayed at the pub all night”. I ask her what time she got home as she doesn’t know I was awake at the time and she says “probably just before 1, the bar was still open”. I go into an anger freeze and don’t know how to respond so bottled up a lot of rage and hurt and just went straight to bed. 

I don’t know if I’m overreacting, we’ve never had any issues with trust before and I really don’t want to start having to doubt her. I fully understand that being unable to confront her is counterproductive, I am extremely conflict shy and internalise pretty much everything as I still find conflict incredibly scary due to past experiences (not with her). I don’t know how to go about this or how to approach this situation as I do actually want to just see the end of it, I don’t like feeling like I can’t talk to her so I just need a push on how to discuss this with her without sounding accusatory or harsh as I would hate to tarnish the gentle relationship we have. Any help would be appreciated

TL;DR my girlfriend lives with me and went out with her friend for casual drinks at a pub, she got home at 3am (I know as I was awake and heard them) and told me the next day that she got home at 1am. Pubs here close at 1am and she’d said that she had stayed at the pub the whole night. I haven’t confronted her yet as I don’t know how to.

How do I fix bad relationship with my mother?,"I (F 32) am married for 2 years (M 34). My husband dislikes my mom (F 64) so much that he will not sit in a room with her unless I am there. He avoids her if he can and uses short sentences to respond to her. It is awkward. This is pretty much my fault since when we started dating 7 years ago, I told him a lot of bad stuff about my parents. My dad wasn't around (he had remarried) and my mother raised us. She's gotten depressed and was depressed and overwhelmed part of the time we were being raised. If I was late getting up in the morning she would yell and scream because she had to get to work. I dropped out of college and she gave me a hard time because of the money SHE had spent on it. I never thought she didn't love me but her anxiety is a lot. And her personality is big and she talks a lot. Sometimes I feel annoyed and embarrassed by her. My brother and sister don't mind this but it drives me nuts. My boyfriend now husband knew all this and just doesn't like her and isn't discrete about it.

  
We moved far from her 4 years ago but for jobs, not to get away from anyone. I have not flown home  per se but met up with her when my husband wanted to see his parents and we stayed with them. She has come here twice. I don't know why I was so annoyed by her the first time, but I was. She could tell I did not want her around and she was pressing me about why and we started arguing. My husband (lhe was my bf then) came in and screamed at her for upsetting me and told her she wasn't welcome. She left the house and I figured she was going somewhere to cool off or get something to eat but she flew home! That freaked me out pretty bad. I thought that was pretty dramatic and so did he and just added to his view of her personality. When we got married, my husband didn't want her involved with our wedding and had his mother do most of the planning. I know that upset my mother. She gave $10,000 and so did my dad. And she came to the wedding, which was near her home anyway. She came to visit us again a few months later and I really tried  my best not to be impatient or annoyed. But my husband hates her and didn't change his behavior and she was really hurt. She stayed the full time but after she got home she said she couldn't come to visit anymore, that it was too painful. Then my brother got mad about how my husband acted and told her that I had told my husband stories about her which is why he doesn't like her and she got super upset. She wanted to go to therapy with me over the phone because she didn't even know what I had told him but I didn't want to pursue it. I thought she should just let it go. Starting then she has barely called me and she usually initiated the calls. When I call she keeps it pretty brief now.

  
We are buying a house and are going to try for a baby next. I want to try to fix this with my mom. I told her I would like to have her come see the house but she told me she is not coming anymore. I spoke to my husband and he said he will tone it down. She basically said that whatever it was I said has made it so she can't face him or his family and that she will not be coming anymore and she is accepting of this. She says I seem to be happy with him and that is what she wants for me but that she will not be treated poorly by people not even her own daughter. She began crying and excused herself and hung up. My husband is fine with this but I am not. I want to try to fix this and if anyone has any ideas on how to start rebuilding with my mother I will listen. FWIW my brother and sister are pretty upset with me but I am not that close to them either. Their personalities are more like my mother which is louder and more in your face. They have both been out to see us here and it was not dramatic.

What do I do when husband doesn't hold up parenting agreements/values?,"I (30F) have 2 kids (5 & 2) with my husband (30M). We've been together for 13 years. We have several parenting agreements that we agreed on based on our values and goals in parenting. One of those goals was low screentime because when our 5 year old gets too much screen time, his less desirable behaviors increase. We recently had to take it away for a few days entirely because the behavior was so bad. After that, we had some more intentional conversations about the screentime limit and we said we would start at 1 hour per day. The problem is that my husband often goes over that limit because he's lazy (his words not mine) but does nothing about it. I am a former ECE so I have lots of screen free laminated resources that hubby chooses not to use. I also have other themed kits for outdoor play, creative play, chill play, etc. I feel very strongly about the use of screentime in child rearing and this is a huge issue for me but I'm not sure how to communicate effectively in this situation or set the family up for success. Is there something else I can be doing to support my husband in not using screebtime as a parenting tool? 

I also feel like sometimes with other issues around parenting that we've agreed on that I'm on the verge of becoming toxic or sassy in my communication when the boundaries we agreed on are overstepped by him all the time and I'm not sure how to approach these issues. 

Tldr: husbands oversteps boundaries and idk how to communicate effectively how this is impacting me. Also looking for tips on supporti g husband in using less screentime in parenting ",0,1l12fd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l12fd0/what_do_i_do_when_husband_doesnt_hold_up/
I (F24) always feel not enough for him (M24),"TL;DR:
I’m stuck in a situationship with someone who only shows up when it’s convenient for him. He’s emotionally unavailable, seeing other girls, and I feel like I’m always the second choice. I know I deserve better, but I can’t seem to let go — and that’s what hurts the most.

------------------

I don’t even know why I’m posting this, but today hit me harder than I expected. We’re not in a relationship — not really. It’s more of a situationship. One of those in-between things where there’s just enough emotion to keep you tangled, but not enough commitment to feel secure.

Whenever I try to pull away, stop answering his calls, or create some distance, he shows up. Literally. He comes to my door, says the right things, finds his way back in — and I let him. It’s like I can’t break the cycle.

He hasn’t contacted me in four days. And today, I saw him with another girl. That moment hit something deep in me — a familiar feeling of being not enough.

We once talked about being exclusive. It ended with him pulling back, giving me even less of his attention. When I brought it up, he told me I needed to go at his pace. That he’s too stressed with life already, and my expectations just add to that pressure.

But the truth is… he only calls when he’s bored. Or when he’s emotionally drained and needs someone to pick him up. Meanwhile, he’s free to be with other girls — and I’m the one left sitting here, stressing, questioning my worth.

What hurts the most is knowing this dynamic isn’t right. I know I’m being used. I know I’m always the second choice. And yet, I can’t seem to let him go. That’s the part that breaks me the most.

There’s so much wrong in this ‘almost-relationship,’ and still, I feel stuck. Sad. Hollow. And somehow still hoping for something that I know deep down will never feel safe or real.",1,1l12cgx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l12cgx/i_f24_always_feel_not_enough_for_him_m24/
Me (24M) and my partner (24F) and wildly different sex drives and I don't know how to handle it,"TLDR; Incompatible sex drives between partner and I due to various factors beyond our control. Unsure how to handle it 

Me and my partner have been together for a bit 
over 2 years now. She's the most amazing partner , she's someone I feel safe and completely comfortable around and I love her dearly. She makes me feel seen and happy, but there's one thing that's slowly building up in me.

For some context here, my partner is on the autism spectrum, she has a condition making sex in most positions painful and she has also had some bad experiences regarding sex prior to us getting together. This, atleast i believe, has made her in general not have much of a sex drive. Taking initiative regarding sex, or even getting horny in general is not something that happens for her unless I take an active role.
Things like sexting, receiving or sending  sexual images or videos make her feel uncomfortable in general.

I, however, have a fairly active sex drive. I'm someone who wants to try, experiment and experience many different parts of sex. I love teasing, I love sexting and everything included. 

This has caused a lot of frustration to build up within myself regarding our sex life. We've had conversations about this before, where we've had good discussions on what we should do so we both feel comfortable but it doesn't feel like anything is actually happening.

No'one of this is her fault, I don't blame her in the slightest. She has no control over her sex drive or her body in that sense and I don't push her in any way out of respect for this. I'm also just in general concerned for her well being.

So I'm not sure what to do honestly. I love her incredibly, she's someone I could spend the rest of my life with. But this frustration building up regarding our sex life is aggrevating.

If anyone else with experiences like this has any advice for how my partner and I could handle this together I'd truly appreciate it.",3,1l11tsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l11tsb/me_24m_and_my_partner_24f_and_wildly_different/
What do I do? I need help. 11 year relationship. 8 year dating 3 year marriage.,"**TL;DR;**  I need help with my relationship with my husband.


This is going to be a long post to bear with me. 

My Husband (31M)  told me he lost interest in with me (29F). I'm about 7month 1/2 pregnant with our 2nd kid. He lost interest in romance and sex but we still get along. I'm not sure if he think we get along as friends or as husband and wife. He told me he still love me but I don't feel it nor see it. We still sleep in the same bed together but it is me who say ""good night,"" ""I love you,"" and kiss. He stop wanting kisses on the lip so I give kisses on his head instead. My husband has told me that he is stress and been smoking(weed) drinking(alcohol). This is something he done through out our whole relationship. 

So to start with romance. He told me he is old fashioned and he's not into romantic stuff like going out on dates or giving gifts. I was ok with it first couple of year in our relationship and didn't mind it too much as we were both tight on money and going out or buying gift would waste money. But as we grow older together and got more serious and better at saving and managing our money. I've (before we had our first and marriage) voice that I would like us to go out on date more and get small gift here and there (little flower1 or 2) not all the time. We given each other Christmas gift the first couple of together but stop after a while. I still give him gifts. On birthdays, he never say happy birthday or gifts. I've done so maybe not so much with the gift but in the room I did such as cute underwear(use your imagination) that I never usually wear. He told me birthday is just another date on through calendar and isn't as important. So that being say you can imagine our anniversary rather it be when we first dating or now that we are married. It just another date on the calendar. Even if I've told him it was special date for us, it goes right over his head and if I remind him. He say that I've never bother with it before. Yes it never really bothered me before because we have rent and bill to pay and we didn't know how to manage our money back then but now we are better at it, I want to do more stuff together. As for date, we don't go out rather it just to walk in park or to picnic or fishing(i love fishing). We don't go out. And if for the rare occasion or time that we do it feel like it a chore for him to do. I'll make the plan for us to have fun but he just want to rush it instead of enjoying our time. And if i try to end it early he get mad and upset with me saying "" isnt this what you wanted to do."" We don't go out to restaurants or movies or shopping unless it for groceries. When I try to think going groceries shopping and try to enjoying our time together and look around and just talk he rush us to get what we need and leave. When we cook together and I try to think it date night. I try talking to him while we cook. If it not a subject he like to talk about he would ask me what im talking about and not even listen to what I say even after I told it something I seen/heard on FB or YouTube. I'm trying to make conversation so that random thing to talk and laugh about but it seem to only bother him more so I just stay quiet and silence. And if he ask me about it I told him I just have nothing to say or nothing to talk about. We have a child now and we talk about our kid alot and what our kid did throughout that day and that pretty what we talk about now. I'm a stay at home mom for now as I am pregnant. I could go more into our romantic life but there isn't much to say.

And now to our sex life. My husband told me he lost interest sex with me because he stress. Before we talk about it a few time. He told me that tired of being the first to initiate sex and so I started doing it instead. I give him small intimate touch here and there whan we walk pass each other. I give him hug and small kisses to the hands, chest, and anywhere i can reach. I've given small butt slap when given the chance or even small touch between the legs when we are flirting which was on rare occasion. And when we go to bed he takes long shower before coming to bed and when I give him massages and reach lower he tells me his tired and want to get some rest. If it on weekdays he say he had along(8hr) day and want to get some sleep. If it on weekends he say he had a long week(40hr) and his tired and get as much sleep he can. If not any of that he move from my touch after the massage or just goes straight to sleep. And on an even more rare occasion(weekend) when I ask if he want a quickie. It feel like it again a chore for him to do. It feel like it only 2 or 3 minutes together in bed and he dosen't even finishes. And of course I don't even finish so when he goes to shower to clean himself, I'll have to finish myself or I'll just stay laying in bed until I fall asleep. Usually after he finishes showering come check on me it see if I was ok before going out to smoke and drink. I usually tell him ""ya im ok. I'm just going to lay here for a bit and maybe take a nap"" so that I don't stress him out. Or make him feel bad. Now that I'm pregnant there no sex at all. We both just go to bed.

Our relationship. So for the pass 2 year of our marriage, I feel like he fallen out of love with me. And he has told me that whenever we have arguments he don't feel like loving me. And that Ive change from being a lay back person and into someone he don't know anymore. He also told me that when we argue he feel like i don't love him nor understand him. And yes I don't understand him sometimes but I would never stop loving him maybe at the moment I might not like him but I'll never stop loving the man I marry and want to continue having a future together. I try to be understanding. To see from his point of view but he told me that im selfish. All he want is peace and I bring nothing but drama, heartache and stress. He want to come home from a long stressful day of work to a loving wife and happy family. I've told him how can I be a loving wife when he don't even try being romantic. Yes come home to a wife and child who's happy to see dad home. But as soon as he come throw the door he give our child a hug and then off to the shower to clean off. And once he come out from the bathroom he's out of the door to smoke and drink for an hr or so. I've told him, if he want a  loving wife he has to at least give me a hug and kiss too after the shower,after he feel clean. Anyways after he smoke and drink, he come home for about an hr or 2 before back out to do that same thing again. The only time he stay long enough in the house was to cook (which he love doing) us dinner. Even after he finished cooking he goes back out to again smoking and drinking. Once dinner done he take another shower(longer) and we go straight to sleep. No more goodnight kiss, no more small talk before bed, no intimacy. Just sleep. And it been like that for 2 years of our marriage and going into 3. As long as we are talking about our child we get along great. On weekends and take our child put to the park and play for 2 hr or so as long as there other kids to play with our child. As long as we don't talk about our relationship or marriage we get along just fine like friends. I do enjoy listening to my husband talk about things his passion about or is interest about because he ever animated and has a shine in his eyes when he talk. And the only other time I see him smile genuinely and happy beside talking about our child. He don't like taking pictures of us(me and him) and told me he just want to live in the moment and make memories of the moment beside being on our phone. Whenever we talk about our marriage or relationship, we get into arguments. And it always leaves us sad and depressed. I've as him ""where are we in our relationship?"" ""what do you see us as?"" ""What are we?"" And the answer I've got was ""I don't know"" ""we are husband and wife"" ""why are you bring his up now"".  When we are talking I've ask him how do I help with his stress. He always tell me he don't know. To argue less to be more loving to be more understanding. For me when we argue he say im selfish for always thinking about myself and asking for more from him. Me asking for more date or me asking him to be more romantic is selfish and that he has have a long day at work or we don't have time or we have more important things to worry about beside us(our child.) I've told him i understand all that but why cant he make time for me. Or why can't we make time one weekend. Again the answer is got waste have more important things to worry about.

**TL;DR;** : So in the end i don't know what to do anymore. I still love him but he lost interest. He don't want a divorce and he don't want to split. He say we don't need family or couple counseling. What do i do? I need help.

Not sure I'm (26M) creating a problem or I'm incompatible with her (25F),"So we've been dating for over a year and we've been living together for most of it (initially roommates).

We started off so strong, and she was so insanely into me. I've never vibed with another person so quickly - it really felt like we were made for each other.

Things started to feel a little weird after maybe the first 5 months. She started to show a little anger problem, and would flip out at me over little things. Saying that, I can be annoying and clumsy and forgetful, so it might be warranted. Her passion is cooking, and she always wants me there to help her, but she's so insanely irritable while cooking, it can be downright depressing to be there. I love her, but she genuinely doesn't see a problem with her yelling. For example, I brought it up at some point and she made comparisons to me sometimes being quiet and said it's just as bad... Is it? On-top of this, she wants me to do soooo much for her. I love her and love to do so much for her but it's taking a toll. For example, I have to grab everything she wants throughout the day, and then I have to give her massages everyday (she has back and foot pain). But it can be insanely dehumanizing when I tell her my hand joints are hurting and she keeps pushing me to massage. A part of me worries that she thinks I'm obligated to do these things because she's working and I'm still studying (albeit a very intensive med course)

After we we kissed for the first time, we were having sex daily for months. But for the last 5 months, sex has gone down to once a fortnight. Initially when frequency was dropping, I would ask if she wanted to, and she would start shutting me down, telling me that asking ruins the mood and puts pressure on her. So I avoid asking her almost all together out of fear of putting pressure on her and getting rejected. It's been about two weeks since we last had sex. Last night we were cuddling in bed, flirting a little bit, I made a move, then she quickly pushed my hand away. I find this soooo soul crushing. On one hand, I feel bad for touching her when she didn't want it. On the other hand, why doesn't my gf want to have sex with me? I love her so much, but I need sex so bad and it's reeeeally effecting my mood. I thought sex would get more frequent after she settled into her new ft job, but it's not. as bad as it sounds, I also selfishly think of her high body count (up to 40 men), and just wonder why she doesn't want me, while loving sex so much. And as stupid as it sounds, I feel like she's had so much more sex than me, and she might be bored of it now. Whereas, I have so much I want to try.

Also I feel like a complete ass, but damn I get quiet and distant when I'm rejected, and I just can't help it. So much goes through my mind when she rejects me and it genuinely sends me into a crazy depression. It sounds so selfish, but I can't help this. I've been looking into seeing a psychologist to talk about things like this.

Is there a problem here or does this happen to most relationships eventually?

TL;DR: Sex is dropping off between us, and I'm unsure if this just a normal progression of a relationship.",3,1l1122a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l1122a/not_sure_im_26m_creating_a_problem_or_im/
Me (M35) and my GF (F34) had an argument over what seems like a contradiction. How do we move forward?,"My girlfriend and I have had our biggest argument yet after nearly 3 years together, and it’s feeling quite final.

Things have been rocky for a while, pretty much since the birth of our baby 4 months ago. I know this is a massive factor in both our stress levels and contributed to our argument, but I don’t know how we move forward.

She had become annoyed that I hadn’t done something I she wanted me to do. She hadn’t asked and it wasn’t something that we do usually, so I genuinely didn’t know she wanted it doing. It then escalated to how my technique to sooth the baby when he cried wasn’t effective, which I agree with. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t, but it isn’t for lack of trying.

I got upset by this and walked off. We didn’t speak much for the rest of the day.

This evening we decided to talk and it turned into an argument.

We often have conversations and within 10 minutes she has no recollection of the conversation. I don’t feel heard, so I bought it up she laughed and said “I can’t help that” which did annoy me. This has been something that happened before baby. It’s like she switches off and goes on autopilot. Responding, but not actually listening to remember the conversation.

She said I’m always on my phone which on our time together, which annoys her.

This is usually when she is breastfeeding. I’ll go and sit next to her and we’ll watch something. It’s always something she has chosen and often something I have no interest in at all. We haven’t watched a single show or movie that’s my choice in the time we’ve been together.

I said if we switched it up, and watched something she likes one day and me the next, or even what I wanna watch once a week or two weeks, I’d probably be more engaged.

She has said she only likes specific things, so that wouldn’t work.

I get bored, so I do acknowledge I get my phone out a fair bit. I’ve put timers on my apps because she has mentioned it before so it has improved.

She said I should talk to her, but she is always uninterested when I make conversation. Some times I’ll get a closed ended response under 5 words, sometimes it’s like she doesn’t even hear me. Sometimes she forgets the conversation within minutes.

I’ve given up trying to make conversation, so I do end up on my phone, so she has a point.

This led into her saying she feels unloved because I don’t hug, kiss or touch her anymore.

Every time I’ve tried to do this for the past three months, she’s pulled away from all 3 or made a comment like “get off” which I obviously do.

Like the conversation thing, I’ve given up trying. I can’t keep trying to touch or kiss someone who has explicitly said she doesn’t want me to.

These were my reasons for what she said to me which I told her and she said “you always blame me” and she kept saying this as I tried to explain I wasn’t blaming her, I was just trying to explain why I hadn’t been affectionate and the phone thing, she just kept interrupting saying “yeah, all my fault” and things like that.

I shouted and said “you’re not listening!” And she said I looked angry. I apologised immediately. I knew I shouldn’t have communicated it like that. In my head it was pure frustration. There was zero excuse for me to shout.

I genuinely don’t what to blame anyone, I was just trying to say that’s why I’m doing what I’m doing, but she takes it as an attack.

I can see how it looks like blame, but it’s hard keep making conversation when someone’s  like “umm” “that’s good” “yeah” or doesn’t acknowledge you talking at all.

She confirmed today that she doesn’t want to be touched, which I get; she’s just had a baby and not confident in her body, I just think it’s odd to call me out on not touching her when I’ve tried to loads.

I’ve tried complimenting her and she’ll scoff or try and embarrass me for doing it.

I feel like I can’t win.

As a side note, as I know this could be a thing, I do all the house work and cooking as she is the primary care giver to baby as she’s breastfeeding. and take care of baby as much as I can.

I offer her free time and she doesn’t even respond to me. It’s like she hasn’t heard me.

How do we move forward?

Tl;dr My (35M) Girlfriend (34F) had a massive argument over things that seem contradictory. How do we move forward?

My bf is too caring???,"My bf (21M) and I (22F) have been together for 6 years. For the first 4 years of our relationship, he suffered from clinical depression. Once I helped him move out of his parents’ house and we moved into our first apartment together, his mental health began to improve. He struggled a lot at first (breakdowns, anxiety, etc.) but slowly was able to grow into a healthier person. We have struggled a lot in our relationship over the past two years. Not only did we move to a new state on our own just months after moving in together, but we both dealt with our own family and personal struggles. 

I’ve developed some depression of my own lately. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life as a result of my childhood experiences and feel as though I’m grieving my family and childhood (I know bf went through a similar thing recently as well). I admit that I have felt exhausted, dissociated, and had a bit of a hardened heart for a few months. Bf is incredibly caring and wants what’s best for me. He asks constantly what’s wrong, how I’m feeling, and implores me to open up and show my “true colors,” whatever that may be. This great, but it is CONSTANT. I feel like all we do anymore is talk about feelings, mental health, and our spiritual lives. It is around 4+ hours every day. This is after I have gotten off work and just want to relax and wind down. Bf says we shouldn’t just self-soothe and should instead work through the problem. We will be up until 2-3 in the morning doing this and then I have to get up at 8 for work. I am not really sleeping.

When I try to bring this up with him, he gets upset that I don’t want to open up to him (I do, I’m just exhausted) and doubles down. Saying that “that proves I need to talk.” My exhausted brain then spirals into anxiety and we end up having an intense conversation before I end up having a complete breakdown. This happens maybe once a week. I love that he cares, I know he is only trying to help me, but I am so tired. I don’t know what to do.

TLDR: My bf constantly wants to talk about feeling and open up to each other, but I just want to relax and wind down instead of having an intense conversation every night.

It feels like he’s never there for me but I might be overreacting,"I (21F) am about to move out and I have no one to help me besides my boyfriend (25M). He currently lives in Nevada and works, and I’m in school full-time in Portland but plan to move down there soon. I’ve mentioned to him a lot earlier that I move out around this time and that I’d need his help and he said he’d help me. I know it sounds ridiculous for him to drive up here (he doesn’t have his real id) just to help me move to a different place for a short time, but I literally have no means of my own to do this all by myself. Now he’s mad at me for bringing it up since it’s going to be happening within the next 2 weeks. I don’t know if I’m supposed to be upset or if he’s in the right to be upset at me because of how insane this sounds.

TL;DR: I’m moving out soon and my boyfriend, who lives in Nevada, is the only one who can help. He originally said he would, but now he’s upset I’m bringing it up again, and I’m not sure if I’m wrong for being upset over him being irritated at me asking.

My (29M) Boyfriend's Mother (65F) is Emotionally Dependent on Him and Thinks I'm Taking her Son Away?,"Me (29F) and my BF (29M) have been together for 3 years and moved in together 6 months ago. Since I have known my BF I have noticed that his mother if very overbearing. She texts hims daily and gets upset/worried if he does not respond. When I met her I thought she was a very kind woman and thought she approved of me. My boyfriend and I have gone over to her home for holidays and birthdays. Recently, however, I overheard her talking with my boyfriend on the phone in tears stating that :

\-she feels like I am driving a wedge between her and her son

\-she is wondering if my bf feels the need to choose me vs her

\-she doesn't feel like his love for me is reciprocated

\-she thought that when my bf would get into a relationship it would add to the family and not take away from her family

\-one time she made a comment when I was at her house about my bf being a momma's boy and apparently I had a ""look"" on my face that she ""will never forget"" (LOL, I don't remember that but okay)

I have never prevented my boyfriend from spending time with her at all. I don't think she has an issue with me personally as I feel like no matter what woman came into her son's life she would react this way. My bf told me that this is just they way his mother is and as he has gotten older he has tried to distance himself from her. When he was talking with her on the phone he didn't say much as he didn't want to make the situation worse and stated that she won't change anyway.

I was wondering how other's would react to this and if anyone has any advice?

  
TL;DR: My boyfriend's mom feels like I'm stealing her son away even though I never prevent my bf from seeing her or spending time with his family",80,1l0x0ig,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0x0ig/my_29m_boyfriends_mother_65f_is_emotionally/
How to ask boyfriend to drive?,"I (f22) have been dating my boyfriend (24) for almost nine months now, he lives about an hour away from me and I live with parents, so anytime we hangout its usually at his place after I drive there. He’s only driven to my place once to drop off my purse after I left it, which I know makes sense since I live at home and maybe it’s awkward to hang out here. But the thing is, I do that hour drive for school every day and back, so during the semester it was fine because he lived on campus so he was never too far from me after I finished class and during the weekends it didn’t seem that much of a problem because I was doing that drive everyday anyway. 

With summer classes, I’m driving an hour in a different direction to another campus, so not as close and the lecture is way longer. I still want to hang out with him, so I suggested seeing him on days I don’t have class, but recently I think I’ve gotten a little fatigued from driving around all the time and I dread getting in the car. I want to ask him if he’d be willing to come pick me up to hang out at his place or if he’d like to hang out over here and do something, but I’m worried he won’t want to because most of the time when we’re together at his place we end up having sex and obviously not a possibility at my home. 

While that’s not a problem for me, I don’t know if it’s an issue for him and if he’d be annoyed by coming down and hanging out without that particular interaction. I’m also just a little sad he’s never offered or asked to come down on his own either. 

TL;DR - I want to know how I should ask my boyfriend about driving to me since I only drive to him. ",0,1l0wy48,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0wy48/how_to_ask_boyfriend_to_drive/
Her parents won’t accept me because I’m going into the trades,"I’m 17M and my girlfriend is 18F. We’ve been dating for 2 months now, but we’ve known each other for about a year and a half. We reconnected around 4 months ago and things have been going really well between us.

The issue is with her parents. They won’t accept me simply because I’m going to college to become an HVAC technician instead of going to university. They haven’t even met me, but they’ve already decided I’m not good enough based on my career path.

I’m proud of the direction I’m going—there’s good work, strong pay, and I enjoy it. My girlfriend supports me 100%, but I know it’s tough for her being stuck between her parents and our relationship.

I want to be respectful, but it’s hard feeling judged by people who don’t even know me. Has anyone else been through something like this? Is there anything I can do to change their view, or do I just need to accept it?

How can I get my (25M) bf to stop lashing out at me (25F) over small things? Are we cooked?,"
Curious if maybe his behavior is reflective of an issue that is too large for me to solve. Looking for hope/input this could be fixed. 

My bf (26M) and I (26F) have been together for 3 years. We’ve always had communication struggles, and eventually we encountered trust issues. He still doesn’t fully trust me, but I do everything I can to make him feel secure.

Whenever we argue, I try to stay calm, validate him, and apologize if I mess up. Sometimes I fail but I always take a step back. Even when he’s mean or uncooperative, I understand he’s not secure in me or our relationship so I stay patient. Unfortunately, it always spirals into “If I was the only guy in your life, you’d act differently,” regardless of what we’re arguing about. No matter how much I try to calm him, he escalates and doesn’t calm down until I break down completely or cry. Sometimes, when I push back after being worn down, he’ll say, “There it is,” as if confirming a narrative about me.

After today’s argument I’m really starting to question if he’s measuring my commitment by what I’m willing to tolerate. The way he digs into me when I don’t comply with his expectations is destroying me (it’s not the first time). 

Today, he got mad because I went back to sleep after my 9am alarm went off while we were sleeping on FaceTime. He was really annoyed after I was sweet and happy to hear him this morning because he’s “Glad that he got his sleep disturbed for no reason.” I asked why he was taking it out on me and it resulted in him cancelling our plans.

Got a text saying,
“You have 0 empathy… you fucked one of my only two days off where I couldve just slept in….just to go back to sleep… you don’t respect me because you didn’t immediately apologize. No sorry, nothing, u dgaf.” 

Even after I apologized, he kept going. Eventually he came to pick me up and gave me an ultimatum of “take full responsibility or we are done.” I didn’t, so he dropped it and agreed he could have acted more cooperatively.

He said he calmed down because he realized I was right and he had to control his emotions more, but is he just saying what I wanna hear? He tells me he wants to make this work too but he struggles managing his own emotions. 

What’s the best approach to this? Should I be more considerate next time? What can I do to make it better? He said it’s on him too, but what can I do?

Tldr: Bf of 3 years escalated situation where my alarm clock awoke him. There is a pattern where situations like these (or me not taking his advice) leads to him saying he doesnt feel respected and thinks I lack empathy when I try to suggest a softer approach. What do?

I think I’m losing my best friend because of his girlfriend and I don’t know what to do,"I 30-F been best friends with this guy 30-M for over 15 years. We basically grew up together. We’ve had seasons where we weren’t super close, but we’ve always circled back. Every time I come home (I live in another country), we make time for each other—he’ll pick me up or drop me to the airport, that kind of thing. It’s just one of those friendships that’s been a constant through everything. Honestly he’s family

He’s been with his girlfriend for about three years now. From what he’s told me, the relationship has had a lot of ups and downs. But I’ve always stayed out of it. I never say anything bad her, even when he vents. I try to be supportive but neutral—especially when he gets upset or dramatic or says stuff out of frustration like wanting to cheat or be petty. I usually talk him down because I know it’s just emotions and he’d regret it later.

Anyway, this time I’ve been home for a few months (longer than my usual visits) and I’ve tried to make plans with him a few times—sometimes just the two of us, sometimes with other friends, even invited him to bring her out so we could all hang. Every time, it’s either “yeah for sure” or “I’ll try,” and then nothing happens.

He has came to see me once and told me his girlfriend got really upset the last time he visited me, and it turned into a fight. Apparently her best friend (who’s also a guy) made some comments about him not being good for her. So now I guess she’s extra sensitive about who he spends time with

But since then, I’ve basically gotten the cold shoulder. He doesn’t really respond, doesn’t follow up, and the vibe is just… off. And this has never happened with us before.

I’m just not sure what to do. I’m not trying to be involved in anyone’s relationship. I don’t want to be the cause of problems. But I also feel kind of gutted. This is one of the few people I’ve been consistently close to my whole life. I don’t have many friendships like this. And now it feels like it’s disappearing.

I’m not even angry, just sad. I don’t have a lot of friendships like this. I don’t want to make things harder for him if she’s uncomfortable. I also understand that as his gf, her feelings take priority over mine. But, I also don’t know how to process this shift. It’s never been like this before.

Should I say something? Just step back? Let it fade?

TL;DR:
I (30F) have been best friends with a guy (30M) for 15+ years. He’s been pulling away ever since his girlfriend got upset about us hanging out, and now I feel like I’m quietly being pushed out of his life. Not sure if I should step back, say something, or let it fade.",0,1l0prxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0prxu/i_think_im_losing_my_best_friend_because_of_his/
How do I(17F) get this guy(17M) to leave me alone without blowing up our whole friend group?,"Okay so this guy in my friend group confessed to me last year, and ever since then he’s just beeb unbearable. I didn’t feel the same, but I tried to be nice about it and just continue being friends. But literally a day later, he started dating this other girl, which already made everything feel fake and performative. 

But now it’s like he’s been guilt-tripping me nonstop and acting super emotionally manipulative whenever I don’t give him attention.

He literally sent me a giant message once where he talked about how “my dry texts were ruining his self-worth” and how I was the first girl he liked after his ex . He kept apologizing for ever liking me, acting like I destroyed his feelings, and basically said he was gonna start ignoring me because he couldn’t handle it. I thought he was gonna leave me alone after that, but nope; he still keeps coming back, trying to get me to talk to him again, acting moody and weird every few weeks.

He’ll overshare random trauma, beg for validation, and then in the same breath talk about how many “sidechicks” he had or how he wants to get them back. On top of that, he’ll randomly start talking about how “toxic” this girl was, how they fought and hooked up, and how she left him. Then he flexes that he lost all his “sidechicks” for her and now wants them back. Like he’s constantly switching between being the sad pick-me and the fake player, and I’m so tired of it. He gives off this energy like I owe him something emotionally just because we talked a bit after he confessed. He told me she sent him a picture of herself in the shower, like WHY would I need or want to know that??? It’s so uncomfortable. I don’t even believe half of the stuff he says anymore, it all feels exaggerated or fake just to get attention.

I’ve tried giving dry replies, not texting back for days, or just changing the subject when he starts venting like that, but he doesn’t get the hint. And the problem is I can’t just block him or go off, because we’re all part of the same larger friend group, and I don’t want to create a huge scene or make things awkward for everyone else. But I seriously cannot take his constant need for attention anymore. It’s draining and making me uncomfortable.

TL;DR:
Guy in my friend group confessed last year and won’t leave me alone. He guilt-trips me, overshares random trauma, and brags about sidechicks. Recently told me a girl he “wanted so bad” dumped him and shared that she sent him a shower pic (ew?). I can’t block him because we’re in the same friend group, but I want him to back off without causing drama. What should I do?

"My girlfriend is tired of always being the one trying to solve our relationship issues, and it’s my fault.","  
So, we've been together for about 4 years now. She's 21F, and i'm 23M. Throughout those four years, we've had a lot of struggles inour relationship. Mostly because of how I handle problems when they come up.

Before I met her, I had never dated anyone, and the same goes for her. Until we met, I never really developed the ability to handle or resolve problems in a healthy way. I come from a very dysfunctional family where no one ever really cared about emotions. I've never heard anyone in my family apologize after an argument or try to resolve things in a mature way.

The way I learned to deal with problems growing up was just to ignore them. I wouldn’t try to find solutions. I’d distract myself with anything to get my mind off it. And I think that shaped me into someone who never learned how to work through conflict with another person.

And that's exactly where problems appear on the relationship. My girlfriend is that kind of person who really like things to be clear and solved, she just doesn't get peace until things are solved.

And i do like things to be solved aswell, but as i said before, the way i learned to deal with problems was simply to get myself some space and let the sadness or whatever disappear. This way i become someone who don't save regrets in most cases. Mostly trying not to blame anyone for the problem and stuff like that.

So, along those four years, she was all the time the active person on trying to solve things. I was never the person who tries to talk about the problems and bring solutions for it. And obviously, after several years of being the only person doing that, she got tired. I was really immature, made a bunch of promises of changes in that field and never fulfilled them.

She doesn't believe anymore when i say i'll change those things, and honestly, not even i trust in my word about that anymore. She started thinking that those changes never happened because i was never interested in changing, but that's really not the case. I love her in a way that i never felt for anyone else. As i said, she's my first girlfriend, so, i never dated anyone before. I would even say that i found out what love is after i met her. Most of my concerns are on doing things that will make her happier, safer and specially confident about herself and confident on me as a partner.

I always wanted to be a good boyfriend and later a good husband. But nowadays, i'm scared of not even become her husband.

Most of the time, when something happens, i get kinda scared of talking about it. Won't save words: i got scared of where that conversation can go, since it can be end up with a break up.

And not only that, i do get anxious to talk about problems without having a clear solution about them. I do know that solutions and solving's are not supposed to be dealt by one person only, since the relationship it's not made by only one person.

All the time i got that feeling that if i don't do everything right, things are going to be ruined.

I'm not a closed person, who doesn't like to talk, but when the talk is about problems, it's like a become another version of myself. Unconfident on me, what i do and what i can do.

How can i handle those things? i'm considering therapy in the next days, but i know that therapy might take sometime so i can learn more about myself and stuff.

  
**TL;DR:**  
Never learned how to deal with conflict, and it’s hurting my 4-year relationship. My girlfriend’s exhausted from always being the one fixing things. I love her and want to change, but I’m scared it’s too late.",6,1l0obzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0obzg/my_girlfriend_is_tired_of_always_being_the_one/
My ex girlfriend keeps on ruining my peace,"Hello everyone, I 23(M) broke up with my ex-girlfriend 21 (F) in December 2024. Long story short, I was putting on efforts but not getting anything in return it kept on happening for almost 1.5 years until I finally decided to become toxic and treat her the way she treated. It was an online relationship we have never met, never even talked on call just texts. I should have walked away instead of becoming toxic because now she just keeps coming back and ruining my peace.

Let's call my ex 'R'. Now I have a cousin sister who is very close to me let's call her 'M'. She was the only family member that knew about my relationship. So M followed R on insta and R followed her back. Now after our breakup I told M that me and R broke up but never told her to unfollow R on insta and all.

Tbh I was doing really good in life everything's back on track I am disciplined, hitting the gym regulay and better than ever until one day she decides to come up with new drama. She told one of her friends that how I treated her and he ended up calling my number and started to threaten me. I didn't know how to react because I was too amazed. It has been 5 months after our breakup and she decided to come back like this. Truly fascinating. I then contacted M to text R and ask her what is all this. She did the same and then R suggested M ke we can make a GC on insta in which we can talk if he(I) want to. I ended up texting her and she fucked with my mental health so bad that I cried infront of M(I never cry in front of anyone doesn't matter how close the person is).

Let's fast forward to yesterday, I was chilling in the noon and suddenly my M texted me and said that R texted her. Now when we were in relationship R once logged in my insta account on her phone but to this day insta shows my profile to her in the switch accounts section even though I changed the password. I told M ke usko boldo mere mein se remove nahi hora otherwise I would have done that. Then after almost two hours R texted me on WhatsApp explaining the issue I resolved the same and then blocked her on WhatsApp too. Now she texted me (SMS) that she wants to talk about something and I should listen to her once and I won't regret that. She then texted me on insta saying I wanted peace this that and said I wrote some letters for you because you blocked me I still wanted you to know. In the letter she said she still loves me and all but she have no expectations from me and she knows nothing can be fixed now but she doesn't give a fuck and she still loves me. I read those letters and took out all my frustration about what she did to me. Idk what the fuck then happened she started ranting about some other guy(different from the one who called me a month back) that he is too mature, she doesn't need to force anything with her, he is very hot, and elder than her. She also told me that he said he has a crush on her but she denied him at that time because she was too confused, but now she is going to say yes to him after sometime as everythings fixed.I didn't react to that I said good for you and all and once she was done talking I blocked her on insta again.

Now I wasn't really feeling anything until a few hours ago. Everything just seems so wrong rm. I have my exams in 4 days but I can't stop thinking about all this I was very bold about my decision until now but now I am very sad about everything I don't know what to do. Any suggestions would be helpful and also thank you if you read it until here :).

TL;DR: My ex came back said she still loves me and then started ranting about some other guy whom she is going to say yes and left.",1,1l0nnm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0nnm5/my_ex_girlfriend_keeps_on_ruining_my_peace/
What should I do ?,"Well Im in this relationship for like 2 1/2 years and now I have come to a point where I feel so fed up and hopeless. (I am 25M and My girlfriend is also the same age)At the beginning first four months of our relationship was so fun and I was so happy, we went fun dates ,constantly communicated with each other, everyday start with a phone call and everything Felt so great. She was so caring, loving, supportive person. At the moment she was working in an office and suddenly after few months she changed her job where she had to do work from home. Her shift was also from evening to midnight night. This is the point where our relationship changed . She has strict parents and she is very obedient to them. She updates almost everything to her mom except our relationship because she knew they ll be serious and strict when it comes to relationships so we kept it as a secret from them. With her new job the connection we had started to loose. I felt so distant from her because we were not able to meet for months because she’s not coming out from her house that often. Even the phone calls we had and the chat we had began to drop. Although we texted I always liked to meet her in person and spend some time with her. I endured this for like 4/5 months and didn’t told her about it , because i didn’t wanted to cause any trouble because she was doing her bachelor and was in here final year. But I held my feelings on and finally came to a point i cant keep it anymore so I Addressed my issue to her that I cant carry out a relationship like this without her presence.  She said that she understands my situation but she said that she can carry on a relationship like this without seeing each because she believes in trust. For the moment I said fine I ll wait for you just get your exams done and finish the degree . Time to time we met each other like once in 2/3 months . Communicating with her also felt difficult because we had completely 2 different lifestyles because I work typically job from 9 to 5 while she was doing a job from Evening till midnight so most of the day time she sleeps and rest to work in the night shift and i sleep at night because i have work in the next day. So just like that our texts also began to drop short and it hit me hard and the distant and pain I had to endure just because I miss her was immense. She was completely fine with our relationship and didn’t cared much about going on a date or meeting me. Then we had few arguments time to time where I asked her out to go on a date where she refused to come out because her parents were strict and she cant tell them about it. Then i asked her to say something else that you have work or something to do but she refused to lie to her parents. So we had these arguments frequently. 

Anyway she was able to complete here bachelor and still our relationship was like a long distance relationship. (Although we live 20km apart). We met few times and each time we go on a date she brings one of her friends. At first I was fine with it because she tells her parents that she’s going out with friends so her parents give her permission . But with time It annoyed me because we are meeting after a long time and all I want is to have some peaceful time with her and she brings a friend which really pissed me off. I told her about this and asked not to bring any friends but she said that’s the only way she can come out and can’t lie to her parents. 

We had so many arguments like these and I was very patient earlier but began to loose my temper quickly after first 1 1/2 of our relationship. I felt so helpless and overwhelmed with the thought of shes not with me. My mood began to change easily because my emotions were totally depending on her. The love and attachment i have with her caused me to behave in this way where I felt impossible to live without her I always wanted to feel her presence, meet her .

Each time I see my friends doing good with there relationships makes me wonder why me? Seeing them enjoying time with their loved ones and me struggling to have proper time with her makes me feel so upset and stressed out.

By the way she went outings with her office friends frequently where didn’t had time to spend with me. Even if we meet , we ll meet at the end of one of her outing with office friends where I come to drop her to her house. So we only get like 1 hour to have a chat . I got pissed here too because she spent good time with her colleagues and go on trips outings but only has 1 or 2 hours maximum for me. I always wandered am i not on her priority list because i felt like i treated like an option.

Then I asked to break up because i can’t continue like this . She said she can’t break up because she wants this relationship. Although I got broke up but after few days she started texting me again saying she cant carry on like this . Then we got back together . After few months we again ends up in an argument and break up and this became a habit. We break up and then getting back to relationship but I was so fed up and up to now this pattern continues. There’s no happiness anymore only we do is argue and both of us refuse to let go even knowing all we do is argue and breaking our hearts. All she asks from me is to wait for the right time for her to fix these things and tell about me to her parents but when i ask when is that going to happen? She says I don’t know. Which pisses me again. Seeing her enjoying with her friends and not me breaks me every day and I don’t know what to do with this relationship . To wait or to let go . 

TLDR - I am having this relationship for 2 1/2 years and my girlfriend barely comes to meet me .

"BF {M23}says he has no feelings for his ex, but she still leans on him emotionally. Should I ask him to send her a clear boundary?”(1 year relationship) {F23}","I just need some outside perspective. My relationship overall has been going really well — no real issues until recently.

A while ago, I found out my boyfriend met up with his ex because someone in her family had passed away. He didn’t tell me ahead of time, which already threw me off. After that, we had a conversation where he said he would cut contact and set boundaries moving forward.

But just recently, she called him again crying about losing a ring he gave her years ago. He says he reminded her they’re not supposed to be talking, but the fact that she still feels comfortable calling him at all is really bothering me. It feels like there’s still emotional access there.

I’ve been considering asking him to send her a direct text, something along the lines of:
“Hey, I’m in a relationship now, and I need you to stop reaching out. I wish you the best, but this communication has to end.”

Would that be asking too much? Or should I just step back from the relationship?
Is this just grief/emotional stuff from her, or is there more going on than I’m being told?

My boyfriend met up with his ex after someone in her family passed. He later agreed to stop talking to her, but she recently called him again crying over a ring he gave her years ago. He claims he reminded her they shouldn’t be talking, but I still feel like she has emotional access to him. Should I ask him to send a direct message telling her to stop reaching out?

My girlfriend’s video game addiction,"I (F26) have been dating a trans girl (F25) since I was basically 18. Lately, all she wants to do is play video games. I’m talking from the moment she wakes up that’s all she wants to do until bed time. I’m wondering if I’m being irrational for thinking it’s becoming a dealbreaker.

For example, if we plan a date or go and do something I enjoy, she is antsy and waiting for it to finally be over so she can get back home to her video games. She doesn’t say that, but I can see it in how she acts and her body language.

We used to live together, but we moved back to our home town and back in with our families. When we lived together I guess I never noticed how bad the addiction was because at least I could spend time beside her and not feel so lonely. Now when I come over she gets annoyed and says she can’t enjoy her game in peace without feeling judged. That hurts and is hard for me to adjust to. All I want is to at least be in the same room as her and feel some sort of connection..

I guess what I’m asking is how to deal with this? Should I just walk away? She has acknowledged how selfish she is being but just chops it up to saying she’s “soooo happy and just enjoying her new friend group.” She acts like I’m an asshole for not wanting to be neglected and also acts like I’m extremely clingy, even though we barely spend any time together anymore. Should I just give up? Giving an ultimatum wouldn’t work cause she’s just extremely selfish and doesn’t care.

I miss our relationship so badly and wish it could go back to how it was in the beginning, where I was a priority in her life. I’m writing here for solutions, advice, people who have went through this and got through it. Right now my brain wants to throw in the towel, but my heart wants to stay because I love her. Please help.

TL;DR; all my girlfriend wants to do is play video games all day with her new friends, and spends no time with me unless I beg. I feel neglected and not sure if I should break up or stay.",0,1l0ljaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0ljaq/my_girlfriends_video_game_addiction/
I really need help saving my relationship,"Me (18F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for almost 11 months. The entirety of the relationship i’ve never been truly happy, but i loved him and wanted things to work out. He was on the same page too. Now everything is basically perfect and i have nothing to complain about. I have this thing where if something bad happens between us my whole perspective on him changes and my feelings towards him change dramatically. This has happened to me three times already. What changes is i loose all the attraction and feelings towards him and start to get repulsed by him. For this particular instance nothing bad happened and i’ve lost all feelings for him now. The last two times it happened it just went away but now i think i want to break up. It’s not that he’s a bad boyfriend, he treats me very good and he loves me unconditionally. i don’t know what to do and i feel terrible. i don’t want to hurt his feelings by breaking up because “i don’t like him anymore”. please give me some advice im really lost.

tl;dr i lost all attraction to my boyfriend of 11 months and i don’t want to ruin the progress we made. i don’t know if i should break up or go through with it.",1,1l0k1uk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0k1uk/i_really_need_help_saving_my_relationship/
21M trying to work things out with 21F who is an ex however she has a few concerns that I'm not sure how I can help her out with,"The story is that we were best friends who became lovers. We dated for about 6 months until one day, an ex of mine came up with screenshots from her anonymous messages app in which someone was claiming to be me and sending her texts about missing her. Couple this in with a conversation during that time (I was unaware of the anonymous messages) on facebook where I told her that I wasn't happy with life and that I was having some issues, she took the screenshots of both my messages and her anonymous messages, twisted it around painting me in a way that I was referring to not being happy in the relationship with her even though that was most definitely not the case before I could even tell her myself that she texted me. We were only 18, were young, dumb, immature and had a lot of communication issues. Now that we have been working on them and things have been getting better, she gave me her final concern.

She does not have any clarify or proof that it wasn't me who sent those anonymous messages and there is a part of her that can't trust me fully because of that, more so because the tone and the vibe of the anonymous texts matched with mine. She knows that she won't ever get anything concrete but it's difficult to brush it off and I'm not sure what I can do from my side to prove to her that she is my world.

Tldr: ex and I have worked on almost everything. The final hurdle is convincing her to fully trust me even though I had absolutely no hand in the situation and I'm not sure how I can reinforce her

I (20F) feel disconnected from my boyfriend (24M) after moving out of his apartment,"During the first couple weeks of us dating, I moved in with him because my job was much closer to his place (my house is around an hour by transit to my work). 

Everything was really good. 

I didn’t expect to be so comfortable with someone so quickly and we rarely ever fought, even though we made jokes like “couples that move in together are bound to get tired of each other”. But it never happened. 

Around six months in, his parents moved back into the apartment with him and noone knows we’re together and obviously the circumstances are kinda weird so I moved back home. 

I didn’t realize how little we text and call each other. My boyfriend’s taking summer courses while working right now so naturally he’s really busy so I don’t want to take away from his work or school. 

But I take a step back and look at our messages and it’s literally just me telling him about my day and his little dry responses and that’s it. 

I see him once a week for maybe 3 hours max now. Sometimes we play games together. I’m not sure if this is the type of relationship I can handle. 

Couple years ago I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and kind of brushed it off and didn’t tell anyone, not even my boyfriend. 

Now that I’m in an actual relationship though, all those sessions about my unhealthy attachment issues finally make sense. 

I go crazy knowing he’s not coming home to me yk and not talking to him about my day and hearing his struggles at work or whatever is lowkey affecting me a lot more than I thought. 

Like I’d somehow convinced myself that he doesn’t want me anymore so that I can move on. And we havent even broken up or anything 😭😭 

I’m just convinced that he shouldn’t be in a relationship with someone who needs attention like me, and that he should just focus on school and work. 

I don’t know it’s just been really hard. Should I just break up with him or like how do I cope. Like I genuinely feel ill.

TLDR: I was living with my man for six months and recently moved out. I’m going crazy cuz we dont really text or call and I see him once a week (maybe once in two weeks). He’s really busy so I get it but if giving me the attention I want is too much, maybe we arent so good together.

My (36m) brother (34m) lives with me and refuses to look for a job,"My brother and I both lived away from the city we grew up in when we were in our early 20s.  I was working out of state and he was in the military.

When I moved back home in 2018 I bought a condo.  He was living on his own with some assistance from our parents while he was going to school using his GI bill after he got out of the military.

Since I had an extra room in my condo I told him he could live with me and pay a pretty low rent.  We're in a high COL area and I don't ask him for much.  He just pays me every month and I take care of my mortgage, all our utilities, internet, etc. What he's paying is roughly half of what it would cost him to live on his own with a regular roomate somewhere in our city.  It's nice to have some extra money towards the mortgage and at first it was cool to help him out while he was finishing school.

Well, he got his degree in 2020, and had talked about grad school.  5 years later he's still not in school and still hasn't had a job since he got out of the military almost ten years ago.  I'm pretty sure he's depressed and I know he has some health issues.  He's a combat vet and is deaf in one ear.  He also has some kind of diet restrictions.  He won't really give anyone any details but I know his stomach and throat bother him.  He gets some kind of disability from his time in service I'm pretty sure.  Again he doesn't really tell anyone.

When I ask him why he hasn't started looking for a job it's ""health issues"".  The thing is he still goes out with friends sometimes, does his own grocery shopping, goes to the gym almost daily,  and other active things. 

It's not about the money, I do fine financially and I've always been happy to help him out..but this was never supposed to be a permanent situation.  It's frustrating that he's almost ALWAYS home.  He also keeps weird hours and is up ALL night every night and sleeps in the day.  Makes it extra annoying since I work all day while he sleeps..then he's up when I'm home for the evening.  I work really hard and never have my condo to myself and when friends and family ask what my brother is doing I really don't know what to say anymore..he's in his mid 30's now and I really don't have an answer.  I've told him several times over the last year that he needs to start looking for work..it's going to look worse and worse to employers that he just has this massive unemployment gap, it's not healthy, etc. 

I've brought it up to my parents but they're getting older and I really don't want to make this their problem.  I know they're worried about him.  A couple months ago I even spent a day making a resume for him and showing him some local jobs he might like.  Even told him a friend is a supervisor at Costco and if he just wants SOMETHING to do for now I could put in a word for him.

When I tell him he really needs to get a job and get busy in life he's basically saying ""Why do you care?"".

I don't know if I need to tell him to get a job or move out..or if I'm overreacting here.  Is there something else I could do to help?

TL;DR Brother is in his mid 30s and living with me.  He contributes somewhat but I'm afraid I'm enabling him to just be content doing nothing.  Driving me a bit crazy that I never have my own place to myself and running out of answers when friends and family ask what he's doing with his life.",9,1l0gj6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0gj6c/my_36m_brother_34m_lives_with_me_and_refuses_to/
Should I change my solo trip to include a potential SO/GF?,"  I (32M) have been dating a lady we will call Alexus (35F) for about 2 months. Around November of last year, I started planning a solo trip for my next birthday. I ended a relationship last year and I realized that the past 2+ years had been pretty traumatic - losing 3 close family members, including my dad. Because I have been in nursing school *and* working full time, I feel like I have been going nonstop. So I decided to plan this trip as a way to be kind to myself, take a break from the obligations I have for others, and prioritize my own feelings and  to focus solely on the things that I want to explore. 

In April, I met Alexus. Things have been going very well between us. We are both self sufficient adults who have traveled abroad for leisure multiple times. We are kind to each other and communicate well 95% of the time. However, we just can not seem to reach an agreement regarding the trip I planned. 

Alexus feels as though she is being excluded. She says that things have been going well between us and she would have expected me to invite her. She also says that because it is my birthday, it stings a bit more. She says that it feels like I am only considering my own feelings and that it isn't a good foundation for a relationship. 

The other important part is that she does have some trauma related to past relationships when it comes to a partner traveling solo and cheating/lying, etc.

On the other hand, I recognize and even understand her disappointment. But, I do think it is well within my right to proceed with the plans I have had for several months - mostly because inviting Alexus would completely negate the purpose of the trip. She suggested - and I considered - inviting her on this trip and planning something smaller for my own getaway. But, that is the perfect illustration of why I need to take this trip to begin with. I ALWAYS end up sacrificing the things that I want in order to appease family, friends, and/or significant others. 

Does this seem like an appropriate request from Alexus? And if not, how can I make it clear that this solo trip is about doing something for me and not excluding her? I am very interested in continuing to date her. I also want to be sure that I am considerate of  her trauma with the way I articulate my feelings. 

TL;DR: I have plans to travel abroad solo for my birthday. I have been dating a girl for \~2 months. She feels it is unfair that I haven't/wouldn't alter the trip to include her in my plans.

Thanks All.

EDIT: Just for additional context, I did change the destination of my trip AFTER we met. I’m not sure if this changes anything.",45,1l0fas5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l0fas5/should_i_change_my_solo_trip_to_include_a/
"Feeling unloved by boyfriend who won't do anything (18M and 18F), don't know how to communicate with him.","I am not the type to usually turn to an internet forum for advice, but I'm genuinely the biggest emotional wreck I have been, in the short life I have lived thus far.

I (18F), and my boyfriend (18M) have been dating for 3.5 months. Prior to relationship, we were best friends, and did everything together. I would say that our relationship was better than we actually started dating. And then, one day he asked me out on facetime at like 3am, and me being madly in love with him, said yes.

He insisted our relationship remain secret, because he wanted to take time to 'figure things out' between us, and not have any meddling from the people around us at school, which makes sense, because of a lot of nosy friends we have. Plus, we just finished junior year, and it made sense to focus a little more on school right before college applications.

But, here is the issue: we haven't done *anything.* It's almost been 4 months. No good morning/goodnight texts, no dates, nothing affectionate, no compliments, TBH it feels like our friendship was more affectionate. Every time I bring up that we should tell our friends, he's always 'busy' and pushes it back. Lately, he's stopped calling me too. He slips in rude remarks towards me at times, is friends with my ex-best friend who he knows I was personally hurt by a lot, and when we talk, it just seems like he's not interested.

I honestly just want my best friend back. I want a relationship that's *good,* not whatever this is. I ask to 'hangout' because he doesn't wanna go on dates, and he can't even make time for that.

The advice I am looking for:

* Is breaking up the wisest decision?
* How do I tell him that I want an *actual* relationship? I'm so bad at communicating and I want to get it across that I don't want to waste my time in something that is barely dating.

my (17F) brother (18M) hates my boyfriend (18M) and it's messing evervthing up and causing tension,"so, i’m 17 and my boyfriend bobby is 18. we’ve been together for a few months, and we go to the same school as my older brother nate, who’s a year ahead of me and in the same year as bobby. nate’s really protective of me and i think it’s partly because of how we’ve grown up but also kind of an asshole sometimes. whenever bobby is around or if i mention him, nate gets really passive aggressive and makes things awkward. like, the other day we were just hanging out at my house and nate was slamming cabinets and acting annoyed for no reason. then he came into the living room where me and bobby were hanging out and basically told bobby he’s a “random guy” and that i shouldn’t be bringing him around. it just felt like he was trying to make bobby feel unwelcome.

bobby’s pretty chill and didn’t want to start drama, he’s naturally a pretty calm person but i could tell it bothered him. what’s even weirder is that nate has girls over all the time, and i don’t say anything about it so i don’t get why he acts like this with bobby. it kind of feels like nate just can’t handle me growing up and having a serious boyfriend.

i want figure out how to deal with this because it’s stressing me out and making things weird. how can i handle the conflict between them without making it worse?

Worried my boyfriend (30M) has unrealistic career goals,"My (29F) boyfriend (30M) has a passion for writing and he wants to become an author. We’ve been together for about 2.5 years. He has an English degree, reads a lot of literature, and is very creative in terms of storytelling and I truly believe he can write a good novel. 

The problem is, he’s overlooking good career opportunities in lieu of pursuing writing full time  when he’s only maybe halfway through the first phase of writing his book. Right now he’s a tech field agent and makes decent money (like 50k annually) but he also says often that he hates his job. His job offers a paid training program where he could learn more advanced technology stuff (I don’t understand tech so I can’t explain it better), but he says he doesn’t want to do it because writing is his dream, not doing I.T. 

He says that all the time he would spend on learning the new systems, which takes about a year, is time he could spend writing his novel. He says “let’s just wait until I write and publish this book, maybe it will do really well and I can finally quit my job and write full time!” But I don’t know if he knows that writing a book can take years to publish, and even then making decent money right off the bat is nearly impossible. 

We don’t want kids, but we do want to buy a house in the next few years and enjoy a comfortable life. Right now we live in low income apartments and we do alright, but can’t afford all the things we wish we could. I just can’t help but feel like he’s setting himself and our future back by not taking the opportunity to make a better living in the mean time. I absolutely want to support his dreams and I want him to write, but also if he has the capability to move up in a field that pays well, I have a hard time seeing why he wouldn’t want to do that now and put writing to the side a bit until we’re financially more comfortable. 

How do I talk to him about this without crushing his dreams? Or am I being an asshole for thinking he should consider a job he doesn’t love over his passion?

My boyfriend M25 was in love with my best friend F 25.,"My boyfriend M25 and I F28 have been together for almost 4 years. When we first started dating he told me he used to have a tiny crush on my best friend and I thought whatever of it. 

Quick backstory, they have been friends since high school and I met my best friend 5 years ago through a job. She introduced me to him. 

Now the other day my boyfriend’s best friend tells me my man used to be IN LOVE with my best friend, like in love. Now I just feel disgusted. I always felt like he still had something towards her. He’s always so happy when she’s around.

For example, we all went to a concert yesterday. I brought up a conversation about knowing someone and he kinda snapped at me saying “I don’t know who you’re talking about” whatever, but when he talks to her it’s just different. He’s positive and makes conversation. I even caught him looking at her during the concert. He’s never really affectionate with me around her either.

I honestly want to talk to him but at the same time I don’t know if I can handle this information and still be in a relationship. I feel crazy. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I cry everyday because I feel like he’d rather be with her. I feel so sad. What should I do?

How do I(21M) get rid of this weird dynamic between my parents and my relationship?,"In high school I meant my current gf (21F) and have been dating for 5+ years now. My parents would never allow me to date usually but for some reason they seem to have let this slide. They are religious and I thought they would immediately stand in the way of it. I know for a fact they are aware of it. One of my friends parents told them about it and it's been extremely obvious.

I hang out with her all the time and other then a snippy comment once in a while they let it slide. We just don't talk about it at all. Like ever. They have even meant her and her parents at school events and seem to like her. 

I'm getting to the point where I would like to be able to be completely open about my relationship and eventually take the next steps to marry her.

"Roommate situation got weird, do I still move in?","hi, i’m looking for some perspective on a roommate/friendship situation that’s gotten complicated.

i (21f) was planning to move in with two close friends next fall. we’ve all known each other for 3+ years and had even toured apartments together, made spreadsheets, and were generally excited to live together. things felt okay until recently.

she and i have always had kind of a dynamic i can't explain. she’s known as the “mom friend”, and she is very responsible,  academically driven, and she has a poised, slightly guarded personality. it’s not that she’s mean, but over time i've started noticing subtle things that made me feel kind of judged or small around her (comments about academics, lifestyle, etc.) she’s will make slight comments that feel a little off, but she says them in such a neutral way that i question if i'm just being sensitive. she enjoys gossiping about other people's status and lifestyle and grades and such. 

sometimes she’s very formal, warm, or talkative in group settings, but when we’re alone, she’s distant and kind of dry, like we are acquaintance. she laughs at jokes before the punchline, reacts unusually early to memes i show, and i often found myself carrying conversations or even sometimes asking questions i already know the answer to just to get her to talk. she never really asks about me or initiates unless it’s something she's personally interested in. she's also a bit dry and cold to my boyfriend. but again, its nothing outright cruel. but it got to the point where for example, i'd hear someone in the kitchen and run out excited to show my other friend something, notice it was her, and instinctively revert to pretending to wash my hands and going back into my room. it's because sometimes i don't even know what to say, and end up saying stuff like ""but anyways,"", ""yeahhh, so"", ""anyways then...""

the tension kind of progressed recently when she made a comment in front of me and another person (a negative comment about someone else who we don't know) that felt like a dig, and i asked her why she feels the need to discuss people that she doesn't know all of the time. i didn't yell or have a tone but i was just kind of barely holding back my annoyance. and instead of responding, she completely shut down, was silent for a minute and then redirected her attention away from me to the other girl in the convo like nothing happened. she didn't apologize, clarify, or even defend herself. since then, we haven’t spoken directly at all. as soon as the other girl left the room she texted me asking if i was okay, and then a few days later she moved home before us. the girl and i ended up alone for 8 days, and she ignored me the entire time, would slip back into her room when i came out of mine, and avoided common areas in ways she hasn't before. when we were moving out of our apartment, she didn’t say hi or bye while her parents were there, but was lovely to my mom and unusually polite to my boyfriend. she only texted after i’d left the building, to say something logistical (did you check out yet). she left without saying bye knowing she will be gone for 1.5 years. 

and since then, she’s still been texting in our group chat as normal, things like “you guys got this ❤️” before a test, ""miss ya'll/ love ya'll"" and stuff. but we haven’t resolved anything, or spoken.

the thing is, i have already made a mental backup plan for my living arrangements. if i do decide on this, the only thing left is telling my other friend in the group i’m not moving in anymore, and i feel horrible about it because she hasn’t done anything wrong and i actually enjoy living with her. i just don’t know how to bring this up without it being a whole thing. and also, i keep wondering if im just reading into it or being overly sensitive. is this even worth ending a whole living situation over? its been a plan in progress for years. 

i guess what i want advice on is: does this sound like a legit reason to not want to live with someone? if so, how should i explain everything to my other friend? and is there a way to do this that minimizes the drama, or is that unavoidable? any advice would be appreciated.

**tl;dr:** had a tense dynamic with a friend for a while (dry convos, judgmental comments, one sided energy). called her out about something, and she completely iced me out with no defense or convo, just silence. now she’s acting like nothing happened in the group chat, hasn't reached out individually, and we were supposed to lease together next year. not sure if its worth backing out or not.

Boyfriend overcomplicates things really badly and I don't know what to do,"I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for about a year, and I need help understanding a critical difference between us. To make a long story short, my boyfriend has a really bad habit of overcomplicating things. I think this stems from a sense of perfectionism, but it's exhausting because it makes simple tasks extremely time consuming and, because it's so time consuming, he often procrastinates and doesn't do the things he's supposed to. 

For instance, he won't make/eat breakfast unless I'm with him because it takes too long (he claims it would take him an hour to make a smoothie and I'm just like...how on fucking earth does it take you an hour to make a smoothie?) and the thing is, I've seen him in action. Cooking even the most basic meal takes 3+ hours because of the all the crazy detail he puts into it (and, for the record, it always tastes like a normal meal -- he's a good cook, but the stuff he's making does not require the time he's putting into it). 

I don't want to critique him on this, because it seems like it's an aspect of his personality, but it's staring to get really frustrating. When I try to help or offer suggestions for how to simplify things, he just brushes them off. This is fine, but I can see how discouraged he gets and how he will go into freeze mode and just not do anything because of how overwhelmed he is by how intensive something is going to be. But he's the one making it that way? Am I making any sense? This applies across all areas of his life except, as far as I can tell, his work. 

I'm also frustrated because this ends up impacting the time we spend together. Sometimes (maybe half the time) I'll come over because we've made plans and it will take him HOURS to clean up around the house, take a shower, etc before we can leave. I end up helping him, which is fine, but I'm always like...hello? We went on a roadtrip together for the first time (just a quick 3 hour drive to his parents cabin in the mountains) and the drive ended up taking almost 6 hours because we had to stop every 20-30 minutes for one reason or another. I didn't get visibly frustrated, but I was so baffled and annoyed. I worry that this feeling will build up more over time and turn into something uglier. 

I truly do love my boyfriend so much. He is such a tender-hearted, caring person, and the other ""issues"" we've run into, if you can even call them that, have been so minor. We're both easygoing, but I'm definitely the ones who's more organized/on top of things/quick. But are we just not compatible? What conversation would you suggest having with him? Am I actually just too ""high strung"" to cope with his slower pace of living life? Is this possibly a mental health thing? 

TLDR: My (23F) boyfriend (24M) overcomplicates things to a frustrating degree and it's driving a rift between us, at least for me. Not sure how to approach it as I've never seen anyone else act like this. ",23,1l00q6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l00q6r/boyfriend_overcomplicates_things_really_badly_and/

My boyfriend m23 and i f21 live each by our own family. We live a 45 min drive away from each other. We had chatted about him comming down to me, but whenever we are going to talk about the specific time, he can never choose a time. It's always ""around these hours"".

So I said okay to him thinking he'll arrive at like around 6-7pm. Now its 5:28pm and he is still with his sister and he hasn't texted me at all about me and him meeting. He's just sent me videos of him and his sister having fun. And that's fine they're having fun, I just feel so unimportant that he is not thinking about texting me that the plan on timing will change.

 I feel like a floater girlfriend. I have not texted him about it because I don't wanna be mean or sound mean and make his mood bad. I just feel sad. Because here I am with no text at the time he said he could arrive on. It feels like he does not want me enough to plan any specific time. Sometimes I can be late as well but I update him a lot about it and apologize when it happens but that's because I run around stressed and packing. But 90% of the time he comes later is because he hangs out with his family. 


And I just feel like I'm below his family. We've only been together for 2 years, but its just... I would choose him over my family. But he wouldn't. And I don't know what to do with these thoughts. I don't know how to bring it up to him. I'm having a hard time figuring out what to do.
.
.
.
I don't know if I'm allowed to be upset at him over him not reaching out to me about the plans being changed?


Tldr: my boyfriend never agrees on meeting on any specific time, its always (example: ""around 6-9pm"") , I feel unimportant..",0,1l00i5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1l00i5k/f21_not_feeling_important_enough/
Do I (F31) have insecurities to work on or is this just not the right fit?,"I’ve been dating my a friend for (f30) for 2 months and we were friends for 3 months before this. 

I’m very calm, chill person but can be extroverted in some social settings. And she’s switched on to go all the time. 

She’s been in 2 pretty awful relationships with women in the past. One was violent and manipulative and another very anxious. They hated on a lot of her friends causing some to cut themselves out of her life etc. 

The insecurities im dealing with is how highly she speaks of a new friend of hers. She was feeling low this morning and says “I’ll switch up once I see Claire”, “Claire will cheer me up”. Last night it’s “I love Claire, she’s my wife, she’s such an amazing great human being, being with her fills my cup” “she’s great she supports me without me needing to ask as she knows I won’t ask” “wifey has my back”.

A barrier I’ve faced is her saying I’m important and a priority but I get very little verbal reassurance so hearing how passionate she is about Claire seems to hit a nerve. So I’m unsure if this is something I need to work on internally within myself or something else. I guess I feel like I want to be the person she says will cheer her up, will have her back. In the past she told me shares with Clare if she’s feeling down and she loves how she immediately asks for a call to talk it through but said she can’t do that with me as it means being more vulnerable and it’s harder to let me in. 

She also has an ex is mentally unwell and pretty much stalks her. And Sarah shared she can’t stop talking with her as she could serious harm herself and she’s lost an ex to that in the past as she her partner at the time wasn’t happy with it. I realised her ex will always be in the picture it seems. Unless her ex stops texting then she won’t stop conversing as she doesn’t want her to lose it and hurt herself. This person will continue being a parasite for a very long time. And won’t let her go. 

Non of this makes me feel good. And unsure on if I should continue. 

She’s has great qualities. Easy to talk to, cared for me when I was very upset, so empathetic and emotionally intelligent. 

TL:DR

Do I need to do something work on myself to be more secure or are these things to raise and maybe part ways due to my insecurities?",2,1kzz76e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kzz76e/do_i_f31_have_insecurities_to_work_on_or_is_this/
I missed my niece's graduation out of fear of getting my girlfriend mad,"My girlfriend (22F) and I (22M) have been dating for over 10 months now. After an event yesterday, I've come to realized that she has full control of my actions.

For the whole time dating, my girlfriend has been very intesne. She is short tempered and gets mad whenever I have to do ANYTHING  that doesn't include her. This includes going out with family and friends. Every single time i go out with them, she constantly texts me and gets upset that I'm not with her. She's always scolding me about how I prioritize my family and friends over her, when I'm not trying to imply that.

Just yesterday, I missed my niece's high school graduation because I was too scared to tell my girlfriend that we should postpone our date night. I feel like such a piece of shit because my niece always went to my graduations, and I couldn't even go out of fear that my girlfriend would get extremely mad. I'm just realizing now that she has full control of my actions, and I can only feel that resentment is going to start building up. 

How should I address this to her? If I tell her that I missed my niece's graduation because of her, she will most likely get mad that I'm putting the blame on her.

Tldr My girlfriend has full control my actions. I missed out on my nieces graduation out of worry she would get angry for postponing out date night. She gets angry anytime I do anything without her.",288,1kzyxg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kzyxg1/i_missed_my_nieces_graduation_out_of_fear_of/
Should I Stay or Go,"I (25F) and my husband (26M) have been together for about 8 years. We’ve had a lot of issues in the past.

I was a sahm for a year and the money from selling our house was supposed to cover anything I would have provided. He was in charge of finances. I always asked how much money we had and was always told “We’re good.” And never given a straight answer. When I pried, it always turned into a huge fight and he would name call and become enraged so it was always dropped. Well, when we moved, I found out on the drive over while trying to find a rental online, that we only had like $1k left (not enough to cover 1/3 of the cost to move in somewhere) and he had racked up $6k on my credit card without telling me he even used it (after I had just paid it down).

I do not trust him with finances and never want to put myself in a position where I have to rely on him for anything again. He is totally irresponsible and won’t tell me if something is wrong. He’s also irresponsible around the house.

I do the majority of the housework. He doesn’t take the garbage out. He changes maybe a couple of our three kids’ diapers a week. He hardly cooks. He doesn’t do the dishes or laundry. Even I mow the lawn most of the time. It’s like I have a fourth kid.

On top of it all, he has a video game addiction and refuses to do any activities in the weekend or even go outside for longer than maybe an hour tops. He just never wants to do anything but play his games. When he does play his games, he yells profanities for the kids to hear and if anyone walks in front of the tv, he has a meltdown. He also ignores any mischief the kids get into while playing so if I leave him alone with them (yes, he is informed that I’m leaving the house), when I come back, the kids have gotten into things they can’t have and made huge messes- he’s totally oblivious.

He’s often in some awful mood too where everything I say makes him angry. He uses language he shouldn’t toward the kids and I and always tries to play the victim when confronted “well, you didn’t listen to me.”, “well, you know I’m trying to do something”, etc. he doesn’t take responsibility unless I spend a good amount of time convincing him what he said was rude and hurtful.

Intimacy is also bad. He doesn’t like me cuddling with him, leaning against him, anything like that. He says he’s always sore so it hurts him? But he does always expect and wants sex and acts like I’m being an awful, neglectful wife when we don’t have sex often.

We have talked about all these things many times. Nothing ever changes on his part. I’ve had a lot of mental struggles in the past and worked on myself. I’ve quit my addictions, I’ve addressed my OCD and gotten treatment for it, as well as other things. He doesn’t ever seem to change. He spends money the second he gets it, he talks how he wants, he plays his games all weekend most weeks, and he hardly does anything around the house.

Well, I thought I knew what I was doing (leaving) but out of the blue, he started being helpful and kind about a week and a half ago. He started tidying up the house unprompted and actually going on family outings with us without moping and complaining about it for hours first.

TL;DR He’s been the way he is for years and years and has never changed his ways. Should I be hopeful because of how he’s been behaving the past couple of weeks or should I just continue with the plans I already had to leave? I do have three kids as well and rely on my husband’s parents three days a week for childcare. I don’t think he would tell them to stop watching the kids on my days, but who knows- divorce brings out bad things in people. I do love him deeply platonically but feel totally disrespected and used by him. Can we ever have a peaceful relationship? Is there hope? Or should I continue my plans?",14,1kzxn9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kzxn9w/should_i_stay_or_go/
My (36f) husband (39m) looks at women online but controls what I wear,"My husband has been very controlling about what I wear. It’s gotten so much worse over the years. We have been married 13 years. The more I give into his demands the more the bar raises and I can never seem to make him happy. For example: I wore leggings and a tank top everywhere. We have 4 kids, I’m an active mom. I go to the gym and work out in the garden. He made a comment one day about how it was skin tight and why does everything I wear have to be vacuum sealed on? I added a sweatshirt around my waist then started wearing oversized Tshirts. Any shorts I wear no matter how long are criticized. I’m down to just wearing pants and big Tshirts everywhere. He claims he can’t stand women who flaunt their bodies and it’s gross to him. He likes modest women. I obviously want to attract him, so I give into his demands. He also does not like if I wear make up when I leave the house if he isn’t with me because “it’s not for him” or I’m “trying to get attention from others”.

Well, yesterday I found out he has been scrolling on FB watching thirst trap videos. What I’m most annoyed about is him lying that he doesn’t like women like that and makes sure to dim me down so nobody can find me attractive, but actively looks at other women regularly. He lied to my face and gaslit me until I found solid evidence of the video history. For the record, we share a burner FB account we use for market place. Neither of us are into social media at all, other than Reddit. I just noticed his Reddit app was deleted. I might have to dig into that. Anyway, I need advice for what to say to him to make him understand he can’t control me anymore, that I don’t dress for others?

Tl;dr: my husband is controlling of me and what I wear because he says he hates provocative women but looks at women online that wear skimpy outfits/bikinis. I don’t know where to go from here.

***UPDATE: he is now ignoring me and giving me the silent treatment after I went off on him and told him I’m no longer conforming to his clothing standards and will wear what I want. This is what he does. He messes up or hurts me, I get upset, he ignores me until I come crawling to him because he knows I crave love and affection. He uses the reverse psychology on me. How can he know he messed up and then turn it around on me? This time it disgusts me. 

Among all our other issues he refuses to cook or help with the cooking load. He once told me “I’ll do all the laundry if you just shut the fuck up about cooking”. He has yet to do all the laundry. We share a business and work together. Our schedule is very laid back. We have the summer off. There is no reason he can’t help with cooking sometimes for our family or even order something. I mowed our lawn and came in around 7. We usually eat around 5. He had cooked himself scrambled eggs and left our 3 kids to fend for themselves. He did make our youngest (8) chicken nuggets. But seriously?! He can cook for himself but not make sure everyone is eating? I would never just cook something for myself without making food for the kids. They said he offered them eggs, but he knows they don’t like eggs. Anyway, this is just another ick and I’m really over it. Yes, I feel rejected. But I deserve better.

Trying to learn how to trust my boyfriend’s (32M) friendships w/coworkers after my ex-husband of 10 yrs left me (40F) to marry his coworker,"Hi everyone! I’m looking for advice on learning to trust my relationship after going through betrayal trauma in my previous relationship/marriage. I’m doing all of the “normal” things (therapy, journaling, etc), but it feels like I’m never going to be able to get past the trauma and PTSD that I deal with from how my marriage ended….

I’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years now. He is literally perfect…..the sweetest, most considerate, most loving, most thoughtful, most supportive, most consistent man I’ve ever met. I literally ask myself every single day how I was able to come across someone with SUCH a beautiful spirit, I feel incredible grateful to be here💜.

The problem that I’m having is that after being married to my kids’ father for 10 years, trusting him FULLY, and then finding out that the coworker of his that I always wondered about and always asked him to draw boundaries with was an actual problem and that they were having a full blown affair (once I discovered the affair, we “worked on our marriage” for an extra year while he continued to cheat and I ultimately decided that I couldn’t be with him any longer…..they got married 3 months after our divorce was final), it’s been really hard for me to trust my boyfriend in regards to his friendships with female coworkers, 2 specific ones in particular. 

I believe in platonic friends and he’s never done anything wrong when it comes to them necessarily, but every single time they interact over text or have conversations over the phone (he will even talk to them on speaker and show me the text convos to prove that the convos are innocent), my anxiety is through the roof. Recently he stated that he wanted to give me FULL access to these friendships, but wanted to delete the text threads entirely to start fresh (to avoid me seeing insignificant texts that may read strangely and it send me into a tailspin) and then give me his password in case I wanted to ever check his phone, at any time. I’ve checked a few times but I hate feeling like I need to, and I never find anything strange.

He doesn’t work with these ladies anymore, but when he did, with the first one, he used to go on daily Starbucks runs with her, help her in her dept a lot, talk and text quite a bit, and she used to pop up in his office while we were on the phone or would call his desk phone a few times a week (he would always put her on speaker, it was always innocent) - she’s married, two young children. With the other one, she made passes at him the first year they worked together (he would curve her each time), but then decided that she would stop with those since he wasn’t entertaining them, they had a short hiatus when she switched jobs, and then she returned to his building and what was once a sporadic coworker relationship turned into a friendship- to the point that now they catch up a few times per month to see how life is treating the other since they no longer work together (she’s engaged but her fiancé is long distance).

He’s gone out for drinks with these ladies plus one other one at his job (that one acts like a little sister to them and I’ve never been concerned with her), and they’re all good friends/had group chats, etc., but he’s never crossed lines that I’ve known of and they refer to me a lot, but I’ve never involved myself either. 

I know that 90% of this anxiety I have is due to the way my marriage ended and my ex husband betraying me with his coworker, and I really want to find a way to get past it…it’s a daily struggle and a big source of stress for me, but he enjoys these friendships and I don’t want to place restrictions on him based on my own trauma. Just looking for practical ways to look at this situation in a healthy way.

TL;DR: My boyfriend got really close with 2 female coworkers (daily Starbucks runs with one, texting, talking on the phone, going out for drinks as a group- one is married, one is engaged) and now that they no longer work together, they still keep in touch, but I’ve been uncomfortable with these relationships since the beginning because of my ex-husband of 10 years cheating on me and leaving me to marry his coworker and I’m trying to learn to trust my boyfriend when it comes to them. Boyfriend has given me full access to check his phone to reassure me that it’s all innocent and has always answered their calls around me on speaker, etc., but I’m still extremely anxious anytime he talks to them.

Advice Needed: I cut ties with my younger sister. Was this the right move?,"Hello,  
  
I don’t even know where to start, but I’m a second-generation immigrant (24M) and I’ve cut ties with my younger sister (18F). I’m looking for advice on how to help her, myself, and my mom.

For some context, I was raised in a strict immigrant household with a strong emphasis on education and respect for elders. My parents worked a lot, so my older brother and I were raised mostly by ourselves. Now, both my brother and I are established in our careers—he has a family, and I’ve been able to travel and enjoy my time.

My sister just graduated high school, but the problems she’s been facing have become overwhelming. She has had issues with staying up late (2-4am) even on school nights, and when she’s up, she’s loud in the bathroom, which is right across from my mom’s bedroom. This has been going on for 4+ years and has only gotten worse.

My brother and I excelled in school—top of our class, graduated with honors. My sister, however, has had serious academic struggles. Her GPA dropped so low that the school counselors contacted my parents, worried she might not graduate. She lies about her whereabouts, has been physically confrontational with me and my mom, and is overall rebellious.

It reached a point where the entire family got involved. My mom tried to set boundaries—curfews, rules, checking her location—but nothing worked. We tried speaking to her kindly, but she wouldn’t change. When we set boundaries or curfews, she’d run away for hours or even days, putting herself in danger.

The situation escalated when she’d say she was at after-school activities or work, but would stay out until 12 AM. I’m the primary support for my mom, as my dad works long hours and is rarely around. It’s obvious that my mom and sister argue constantly, with my sister blaming my mom for everything. Eventually, my sister decided to cut off the entire family and live with her friends. This has yet to happen, but my mom is not doing well with this decision.

I’ve talked to her about the reality of living on her own, especially with tuition to pay, but it hasn’t helped. What’s worse is that I’ve never seen my mom so stressed. Over the last few days, I’ve spent 10 hours just listening to her and trying to support her emotionally.

I’ve decided to cut my sister out of my life because her behavior has caused too much pain for both me and my mom. Despite reasonable boundaries, she’s pushed us to our breaking point, and I can’t keep enabling her. My mom is still anxious about it, and the stress is beginning to take a physical toll on her as well. Nothing seems to get through to my sister even if I'm nice/mean emotional/logical, etc. 

**TL;DR** I’m a 24-year-old second-generation immigrant and I’ve cut ties with my rebellious 18-year-old sister due to her constant disrespect, academic struggles, and boundary-pushing behavior. Despite my mom’s efforts to set boundaries, my sister’s actions have caused emotional and physical stress in our family, and I’ve reached a breaking point where I can’t enable her anymore. I'm looking for advice on how to help my mom and myself cope with this situation.",0,1kztonv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kztonv/advice_needed_i_cut_ties_with_my_younger_sister/
I feel emotionally neglected.,"How should I (22F) communicate to my boyfriend (21M) that from now on im not gonna text him until something important comes up, and if we do wanna talk to each other it’s either we call or meet face to face, or have an actual conversation where it actually doesn’t get cut off in the middle of it then waiting a few hours for a reply. Like it’s getting kinda stupid to me. We’ve been together for about 3 months. 

And like what he says, “i also dk why im so busy” even when he’s an ACCA student since 2021 JANUARY BRUH, and it’s not like he super actively helps his mum with the shop. I need to reevaluate his priorities because i think i put out more emotional labor into this whereby I kinda plan on when i should see him?

plus im gonna go over to work in singapore soon in a few months or so, if he can’t even handle this irl, what about when we’re long distance. If it’s gonna be like this, I’d rather we stay friends or not be in a relationship.

TLDR:
I’m done with dry, dragged-out texting. From now on, only calling or meeting if we wanna talk properly. I feel like I’m putting in more effort while he’s just vaguely “busy.” With me moving to Singapore soon, I need to rethink this relationship — if it’s already like this now, long distance won’t work. Might be better off as friends.",1,1kzrl3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kzrl3c/i_feel_emotionally_neglected/
I (22m) am always having to apologize to my gf (21F),"I’m at a loss for what to do we have been in a relationship for almost 2 years and for every argument we have I’m always the one who has to apologize every time and then there are times when she just blows up at me over the smallest of things

For example. One night I was putting up the dishes and she just blew up at me bc I had placed one in the wrong spot and it lead her to yell at me and kick me out the kitchen and said I don’t want you in my sight and even threatens to end the relationship

Another example would be I work nights I go in at 3:15 am so I was sleeping n she was on the phone with her friend she was being a little loud I asked if she could be a little quieter and she was but I guess she got excited I woke up n then started to mess with me n tried to put a little piece of trash in my mouth n I said can you stop im trying to sleep then from there on she left n then yelled at me for being rude

I know that sometimes it is my fault and I own up to it and try my best to make it up to her when it is but almost every time she hurts me or is rude to me I have to be the one to apologize it’s gotten to the point where I start to get anxious just going to Costco with her as she has blown up at me so many times just going there bc I don’t find parking fast enough or I’m not grabbing the right thing

I love this girl even after everything but there has been times where she has just hurt me beyond belief and Iv started to feel lost

TL;DR I apologize even if it wasn't my fault and she is very defensive and doesn't like to admit it was her mistake.",2,1kzqvb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kzqvb2/i_22m_am_always_having_to_apologize_to_my_gf_21f/

Tl;dr my bf says he misses the thrill of falling in love 

Hi so i need some advice. My boyfriend (19m) and i (18f) have been in a relationship for 8 months now. Since the moment we met it felt like we have known each other forever and we practically live together. We have a good balance between friends and our relationship. I've never met anyone who gets me the way he does and i've never resonated this much with a person. We both really value that we are able to understand each other well. Thus, we have many open and honest conversations. Recently, we were talking and he brought up the fact that he really misses the thrill of falling in love. How now everything is pretty calm in our relationship and he feels like its peaceful but also boring? He said he's felt like this for the month. He was talking about how he just really craves the honeymoon phase , the getting to know someone part all over again. He said he wants to fall in love with me again but im just unsure on what to do with this. I dont feel this way, i really like how peaceful our relationship is. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he's been in relationships throughout his whole conscious life to be honest (since he was around 12) so he doesnt know what life being single is like, while i do. I dont want to feel like hes bored of me and he said its not an issue with me, just something with him. I get that its something he has to process himself but how? How can i help him? Anyways, im just really unsure on what to do. Has anyone gone through something similar?

University class friends have stopped talking to me before graduation,"Hi, i (21F) have two uni friends (22F) and (23M) who are in my class. I got really close with the last two years. Especially with (22F) whoI've known her since first year (we have four years of uni). I've been noticing for a while they have been icining me out for no aparent reason. It came to ahead now that now exams are over I messaged the group chat they are all in if people would like go and do something fun but they have left it without replying for 11 days now. I know that (22F) is online but just not replying and both are in the city for as far as I can tell. Why could they be ignoring me? We haven't even graduated yet, we still have time and I have been spending time with other university friends. 

I've been wracking my brain and I don't think I've done anything actively wrong to them that would warrant being iced out. The only thing that comes to mind is that I got upset over group chat messages because they didn't tell me about an exam after I couldn't attend a lecture (basically saying similar to ""why didn't anyone tell me😭"" ). The final message I sent on this theme was never seen by 22F and was sent two weeks ago. But even before this they have been super weird and avoiding me since the easter term started (April/May). I know this is more than overthinking when at a birthday party 23M avoided me then walked home with another friend (23NB) without me, leaving me alone in a part of the city I feel very unsafe in . 

So what do I do? I've messaged them both privately saying similar to: ""if you aren't busy we could do something but it's no issue if not"". Should I have messaged them privately? And if they don't reply do I just give up? Because it will be very awkward in the graduations to be seeing and sitting by them, especially as now I'm upset at them for ignoring me both online and in person. Have I misconstrued it and they are just wrapped up in their own problems and aren't texting me back because of them? 

Thanks in advance reddit 

TL;DR uni classmates are icing me out, what do i do? Especially as I am seeing them at graduation and I care about them

Best Friend's Boyfriend Totally Sucks,"My (24F) best friend, 'C' (24F) has recently started dating my boyfriend's (25M), friend (24M), 'N'. 

For context, they met around New Years 2025, so it has only been 5 whole months that they have been dating. At first, he seemed cool and fun, I symathized with his broken past (orphaned, parents used to do drugs, his parents both recently died within a year). 

However, his insecurities cause many issues for their relationship. Starting with the first fight they had, which was around March (3 months dating), he got upset with her for not admitting her body count, which he demanded to know. She never answered because she knew it would only lead to a negative reaction, or it just didn't matter. Weird, right? He explained that it is important for him to know things like this. Within this same conversation, C mentioned a friend who has been 'hooking up' with this girl she knows from her school. He got furious that her friends subscribe to hook up culture, and that it is a bad reflection of her having these kinds of people in her life (to influence her). Lastly, he asked if she has ever dated a black guy (they are both white), to which she truthfully responds, 'yes'. That fight blows over, but the more recent, prolonged one ensued as follows.

C got accepted to study abroad for the summer (1 month). She applied well before she even met N. The days leading up to her leaving, N expressed he was uncomfortable and even admitted insecure about her leaving. He mentioned again, he does not even know her body count or her whole dating history, and to top it off, he also cannot stop thinking about the black guy (lol). He claimed that not knowing these things attributed to not knowing her character. So, she needs to prove herself worthy to him. Ew! This broke her heart that he needed all this extra info to be able to think well of her, because he could only imagine what she has done in her past. The entire week before leaving, she was anxious due to his unstable emotions. Another instance was she and N went to her hometown 45 min away to visit her parents and friends who came from out of town to have a reunion/going away party. N chose to finish his hw that night, so he was not present during the party and he did not even say goodbye to everyone that night. This also hurt her feelings, of course. Overall, they fought about everything and she would tell me how she was constantly crying. To me, how can a grown man be okay with making his woman cry? 

He also constantly drags C for working too much. She is in law school and also works at a firm as an apprentice lawyer under supervision of her boss. N is in school for Kinesiology so he claims the stress is killing her. Also, he hates her cat. I think both of these things are 'distractions that divert her attention away from him'. He has not admitted this, but it is what it seems. When he should be supportive, he tries to tear her down. I have dated a very toxic guy before, and I can see a lot of similarities in him.

I highly respect my friend, and I love her so much, but I am afraid of losing her. Whether it be because she ditches her friends to give attention to N, or I get too fed up with constantly hearing about what she puts up with.

I suppose I am asking reddit for advice?

How to leave someone I genuinely love but can't trust anymore,"if anyone reads this, ily. My(22) boyfriend(24) and I met last year in April 2024. We were both doing an internship in the same city. We had a month-long rendezvous and it was a great time for both of us.  At the early stages of our dates we agreed that we didnt want a relationship because we would both be leaving in May 2024 back to our cities and didnt want to do long distance. Fast forward May 2024, when we're both back in our town, he wants to keep talking to me and we decided to be exclusive. He flies down to see me in June 2024 and we officially start dating August 2024 because I had moved back to our internship city which was only a 3 hour train ride to his city. It didnt feel like a long distance relationship because I would at least see him once a month for an extended amount of time because he has a remote job. I meet his family in September and he meets mine later on in November.

All is well until December, im catching up with a male friend who also did the same internship in the spring and knew him and I. When i mention to him that Im dating him his face changes and he warns me that hes not a good person. I ask why he says that he would cheat on his previous gf and he hooked up with a another girl in the spring. I confront my boyfriend about this in person the next day and he admits the cheating on his previous relationship and tells me all the details. Up until this point we had never spoken about each others pasts. I also ask him if there was any overlap with me and any other girl when we went on dates. i also ask if he slept w anyone else in the spring bc we had slept together and i wanted know. he denies and only says he kissed another girl in the spring but it was before he met me. I decide to believe him but explicitly said ""if i find out youre lying to me about any of this information im going to break up with you"" he agrees and we carry on.

fast forward April 2025 i find out he was lying. he did sleep with another woman a day before our first date. I confront him about this detail and he confesses. he leaves the room for a few minutes, comes back, and proceeds to tell me that he also slept with another girl in May 2024, 2 weekends before we both went back to our hometowns. that weekend he told me we wouldnt be able to see each other because his cousins were coming into to town. (obv a lie) he says that the girl was from his hometown and he had split a hotel and scheduled all this a little before he met me.

Well, when he told me this i stood on business and broke up with him. It was clear that he was hurt but he understood/respected my decision and agreed to go no contact with me. I broke no contact after 5 days. Its been a little over a month and we have been in contact and we are trying again because I genuinely do believe that he is remorseful and is changing. I told him that if we are going to get back together he's going to need to give me time and ask me out all over again. He understands that im more upset about the lie than the actual things he did when we were talking because we had both established that we didnt want anything more.

Our relationship has been the best one i've ever had (despite the lying, yikes). i KNOW hes never cheated on me, hes always treated me right, yada yada yada. The only reason why I'm trying again is because I love this person. The only thing that has changed about how he treats me now is that hes  being very understanding and attentive to how im feeling about the situation and if i want to talk about it he talks about it with me. He is very sweet, attentive, and makes time to talk to me every day, which is literally how he would treat me throughout our relationship anyway. He has given me no doubt except for those lies. Not sure what to do since I do want to get back together with him but now im just starting to doubt him about random things.

Obviously im hurt about him lying and also grossed out about him hooking up w 2 different girls in the month that I first met him. The thing that is hard to move past is just the lying. I dont want to be in a relationship where im doubting things he tells me or second guessing things. Im not sure about what to do.

TL;DR: I caught my boyfriend in a lie and I dont know if I should continue with him.",2,1kzh8a3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kzh8a3/how_to_leave_someone_i_genuinely_love_but_cant/
I don’t know if and how I [15M] should end my relationship with my girlfriend [17F],"TLDR: Should I end my relationship with no romantic spark that I’ve realised I’ve been staying in out of guilt? Or is it still possible to revive the relationship?
And if so, should I break up after exam season or ASAP, given that going on a break isn’t an option?

I’ve been dating my girlfriend for nine months, and known her for basically a year. Back then, when she confessed to me, I didn’t really know much about love. But I still wanted to try things out and see where things would go, even though I only valued her as a friend.

I wasn’t someone who liked looking into the future, but her kindness and her constant gifts made me feel really valued, and she eventually became one of the only people I could be weird and stupid in front of and still love me for who I was.

Although everything seemed good during our honeymoon phase, I always had a weird feeling that something was off. For the whole time, I was searching for a spark in our relationship, but that spark never came. We did many things that couples would, and yet it didn’t feel intensely romantic. I also realised I never truly appreciated her gifts and her being there for me; it only just hit me now.
She was anxiously attached to me; she would constantly shower me with love and affection. It seemed fine at first, but after some time, it started tiring me. 
I never broke up with her because it feels like fixing what we have would hurt less than breaking up. It did work, though, I guess. Every problem we had, we resolved it in the end, and she would grow as a person. And now she went from a loner who hated everyone to someone who has a huge friend group and liked everywhere around college. Our relationship always seemed to strengthen after each argument, but our core incompatibilities still remain.

She was already anxiously attached from trauma from her childhood, and my indifference to her sometimes is definitely not doing her any good. It’s at the point where she starts monitoring me whenever I go out, being cautious if I’m near any girls. Every time she senses distance, she showers me with affection. 
She’s not good at communicating either - I have a huge tendency to overthink, and she only ever tells me the problem when I have to ask her persistently. Normally, she never tells me what the problem is. This means every time she starts being “off”, I start to overthink and ask her a bunch of questions to get to the root of the problem (I realise this is also partly my own problem, but her communication style doesn’t exactly help, and it’s hard for her to openly communicate despite many arguments about this).
I also realised that the time I cried out of “love” for her, it was just out of pure guilt. The love that she had shown me and the fact that I couldn’t reciprocate it keeps feeding my guilt, so I just kept on letting her love and affection chain me in the relationship so I could prove to myself that I could love her like she loves me.

At this point in the relationship, it seems like I’ve reached a kind of stable point where there aren’t as many ups and downs. I’ve subconsciously searched for reasons to break up with her for a long time, and now I’m kind of mentally checked out. Every time we argue nowadays feels draining to the point I just want to break up, but I convince myself I’m overreacting. 

It’s just hard to let her slip away when she’s one of the only people who truly love me for who I am. We can act however we want around and we still never judge each other - and we could always smile and have a bunch of fun.  It’s eating away at my self-esteem too. I feel like I’ve absolutely failed this relationship. 
My birthday is coming up and she has gifts for me, which just feels pointless if I’m going to break up with her. Another part of me is telling me to continue the relationship, because although I’m not IN love with her, I still love her, and maybe I just haven’t been trying hard enough.

I have important exams that will end in about two weeks, and I’m struggling with what to do. I can’t go on a break with her because I had already tried it. Should I try to end it now before my birthday gifts, or should I receive them and wait until after the exams and sort it out afterwards?",2,1kzgoyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kzgoyj/i_dont_know_if_and_how_i_15m_should_end_my/
Feelings for a friend,"I (30m) have a female friend (37) I’ve known for quite a while, but over the past few months, our bond grew deeper and more intense. We talked about almost everything and felt really comfortable with each other.

We recently went on a two-week vacation together. At first, everything felt like normal friendship to me, but I soon noticed a shift – something between us started to feel different. There was a tension in the air, something unspoken. We spent a lot of time together, I made her laugh a lot, we drank together, had deep conversations. There were no explicitly romantic signs, but she didn’t shy away from physical closeness either.

For example, during a long bus ride, we sat right next to each other, touching shoulders and legs the entire time. She could’ve moved away but didn’t. That kind of proximity just didn’t feel like pure friendship to me. Then again, there were also moments where she seemed more distant – sometimes saying she needed a “break” because the trip felt overwhelming (to be fair, it was quite packed and intense). In the end, she even flew home two days earlier than planned.

Especially during the last days of the trip, it felt like the emotional tension between us peaked. Nothing ever happened physically, but I had to seriously hold myself back – which is unusual for me (I am usually more of a coward in this situations). On the last night before she left, she stayed up drinking and talking with me far longer than she originally intended.

After she went to sleep, I texted her and told her honestly that I liked her – not in a pushy way, just openly. The next day, she replied that for her it‘s only friendship. That hit me really hard.

The contact afterwards felt odd. Sometimes she replied like everything was normal, sometimes not at all (though I know she has ADHD, which might explain some of the inconsistency). Eventually, I suggested we talk in person again.

During that talk, I asked her if she really never felt anything between us. She said no – for her, it had always been friendship. She also told me she’s currently emotionally focused on someone else – a guy she’s been seeing for a while now and with whom she‘s in a kind of open relationship. She has a very avoidant attachment style and seems emotionally blocked in many ways.

After that, I sent her one final message. I told her I respected her answer and didn’t blame her – but that it had hurt me deeply, and I wasn’t sure I could continue the friendship as it was. Her tone had been very distant and emotionally detached, and that really added to the pain. She never responded to that message.

Now I’m stuck here feeling lost, confused, and unsure what really happened – what it meant to me, what it meant to her (if anything), and whether there’s any future at all for our connection.

TL;DR:
I went on a two-week trip with a close friend (f) and developed feelings. We had a lot of emotional and physical closeness, but she said it was “just friendship” for her. After I opened up to her, she became distant and eventually stopped replying. I’m confused and hurt, and don’t know how to move on or whether a friendship is still possible.

I (31F) am tired of initiating contact with friends and family. Should I stop? Opinions welcomed.,"Hey everyone. I’m feeling disappointed in pretty much all of my friends and family at the moment. 

I’m not one to play victim as I believe some people are a glutton for punishment, and should take responsibility for their own (inter)actions.

I’m very understanding of that fact that most of my friends work AND have children (and I don’t have kids). Also understanding of family members who either aren’t 100% in health, or work demanding jobs, or are airy fairy student types… but I’m SO SICK of always checking in on them first. Asking what’s new. Asking when they’re free to meet for a coffee.

My sister (21F) replied today to a text I sent her TWO WEEKS AGO asking if she wanted to hang out this coming weekend.  She’s usually at Uni in different city but is back for the summer. I never hear from her when she’s out of town and I let it slide since she’s so much younger, and I appreciate that talking to her big sister might not be high on her social agenda. Whenever we do actually hang out we get we get on so well and I love her to pieces! 

Since she returned in April I’ve seen her twice (she’s not working by the way). Once to help set up our mum’s small birthday party, and again to help clear the house a bit. No comms outside of this. 

She replied with “hey!!! Sorry I’ve been super busy and didn’t see your text. Sorry I can’t hang this weekend I’m visiting my boyfriend or I totally would!” (bf still at his uni in a different city). 

I’d had it by this point so I replied with “Two weeks. There’s busy, then there’s just inconsiderate, especially when someone else is trying to make an effort. Everyone has stuff on but it takes 2 seconds to reply, even if you can’t make it or to say you’re not feeling 100%, which I’d be understanding of. Have some courtesy.”

No reply since (obviously).

But it’s not just her. It’s most people. It hurts because whenever we do speak properly, or meet up with these people it’s lovely and we roar with laughter and they’re all “gosh it’s crazy at the moment! I’m so sorry it’s been so long, but it’s been amazing catching up!”.

These are people I’ve known YEARS (or my whole life!), and have had the deepest conversations with. I had to have an emergency appendectomy last year and they really showed up for me, and I’ll be forever grateful. 

But after that, back to usual. The most I usually get is a meme or funny clip sent to me. Not actually asking after me. I think I would feel unreasonable messaging them with “I just feel sad, that whilst you’re busy with a hormonal teenager and a toddler, and also work, and are working to stay on the wagon, that after all these years of friendship you don’t take the time to text ME”…. 


I have a lovely encouraging partner, we live together and have pets and our own thing going on - so I’m not twiddling my thumbs, but the resentment for others has just been building gradually.


I’m sure you’re thinking “they’re just used to you messaging first!” … but don’t they want to know how I am if they haven’t heard from me in a while? Or maybe you’re thinking “just meet some new friends!”. You’re talking to the woman who doesn’t like sports/outdoorsy stuff, games, cooking, crafting. Transparently, volunteering sounds like a hole in the head. Relaxing watching a good telly series is my preference. I work a very peopley job, and I’m just not sure I have it in me to be Tour Guide Barbie with new people…. But something has to change. 


I think I’m going to test a month of not initiating contact and see what happens. I might laugh / heart react to a meme if it’s sent… But unless it’s a genuine question I won’t reply.

Care to weigh in? 

Any personal experience? 

Perhaps the opinion from someone who’s guilty of forgetting to message friends? No hate.

I(M20) want to love her(F20) but I feel nothing. What do I do?,"I’ve been talking to this girl since the beginning of the year. The thing is she’s exactly the kind of woman I’ve always said I wanted. She has the mentality mindset values, everything I’ve been looking for. She’s mature understanding and emotionally grounded.

But while we’ve been talking I ended up falling for someone else someone I eventually broke up with. After that I was seeing another girl. And now I’m here realizing that I don’t actually have real feelings for this first girl I’ve been talking to for so long.

And it’s killing me because I want to love her. I want to focus only on her. She’s loyal she genuinely loves me, she’s obsessed with me in the best way and even her whole family knows about me. She traveled a long way just to meet me and I finally saw her in person for the first time recently.

I’ve done things for her. I’ve bought her gifts and tried to show that I care. I’ve been trying to build something real with her. But it still doesn’t feel like it did with other girls. With past relationships I’ve felt the spark the butterflies the excitement and I don’t feel that here.

To be completely honest I’ve dated women in the past who were very beautiful and she’s not as beautiful to me. I don’t know if that’s shallow or wrong but I can’t lie and say it doesn’t affect me. I wish it didn’t but maybe it’s part of why I’m struggling to feel something deeper.

I was hoping something would change when we finally met in person but it didn’t. I still didn’t feel the attraction or the emotional pull I was hoping for. And I hate this because she deserves love. She deserves someone who’s crazy about her. She’s done everything right and I still feel empty.

I feel stuck. I don’t want to hurt her. I don’t want to break up with her. I’m scared of how it’ll affect her and what her family will think. But how can I stay in something when I don’t feel what I know I should?

Is it possible for love to grow over time? Can you choose to love someone and eventually feel what’s missing? Or am I just trying to force something that isn’t there?

I don’t know what to do. I really need some honest advice.

TL;DR: Been talking to a girl for months who is 
perfect on paper and loves me deeply. Finally met her in person and felt no spark or attraction. I’ve dated girls I was more physically attracted to and feel guilty that it matters.

I (20NB) have been with bf (20M) for a couple of months and just don't know anymore,"I know reddit os probably not the place to come for advice but.

my bf (20M) and I 20(NB) got together a few months ago (<6), but have known eachother for years as we went to school together. he's a very sweet guy, respects me and hasn't done anything wrong/to hurt me/anything like that. before he asked me out I felt extremely lonely and as if I was undesirable, weird, off putting, nobody would ever want me, etc, that type of thing, and when we did get together I was very happy.

recently I haven't been so sure and have been considering whether I should end the relationship - I do love this guy, but I don't know if it's like that (I have a lot of trouble distinguishing between what parts of what I feel for people). I also just feel that I'm not good for him, even if he says things are okay. I've been having less energy to hang out/spend time together even when I know how much he wants to. I hadn't been with anyone for over a year before him, but my previous relationship had been long and I had been ready to spend the rest of time with that person, and I feel guilty that I don't feel the same way with my current bf - there isn't anything he's done to prompt this, and I know I haven't been with him for as much time, but I don't like that I am having second thoughts even if it is early on.

I have been having a rough time with mental health/gender dysphoria recently so I don't know if I'm just having a tough time and being down on everything or if I truly am unsure and I don't want to make any big decisions that I might regret, but I also don't want to be stuck with these thoughts of ""do I really want this"" because I feel horrible about them. I don't want to hurt this guy because genuinely he doesn't deserve that but I also don't want to lead him on in any way and I feel stuck. Also, with the way I felt before our relationship I don't like the thought that im having that maybe i only said yes to him because i was feeling lonely at the time. I would usually talk about something like this with my friends but they're friends with him too and I don't want them to form any type of view on our relationship so I'd rather do this and be anonymous. I want to speak to them when I'm more sure of how I feel

Toxic to healthy?,"Is toxic to healthy possible and how do I tell my family now that they don’t want me with this person? 

I guess I’m just wanting to lay everything on the table and get advice from outsiders. I’m a 29F, single mom, 9 year old son. My ex is a 29M. 

**TLDR** we were unhealthy broke up for 6 months and now things feel better. How do I tell my family? 

When we first started seeing each other 5 years ago, we were both in stages of our lives where we were drinking a lot and sort of in “party scenes”. I wasn’t a single mom at the time, my son’s dad was very involved in his life. (My sons dad and my ex are two different people - just to clarify)

My ex and I were just unhealthy. We both had traumas from our childhoods that triggered each-other. Things I did triggered him and things he did triggered me. Our communication was HORRIBLE and I never felt heard, understood or seen by him. He would often criticize me (I seem to have some kind of pull towards men that don’t think I’m enough, gotta love daddy issues). I felt manipulated by him in a way that he would say what I wanted but actions didn’t usually reflect through over time: We also have extremely different attachment styles, I’m a fearful avoidant and run fast as fuck any time my nervous system doesn’t feel safe. He’s an anxious attachment and just wants to fix fix fix everything right then and there. 

In the beginning we had some trust issues not because he cheated but because I was ready for commitment way before he was and the first year-2 years of our relationship didn’t feel like we were actually together. He wasn’t cheating or seeing anyone else, but he liked girls photos, did things that made me feel like his eyes wandered. That created a dynamic where I didn’t trust, wanted to run but still felt so safe and comfortable with him and was basically running off the “idea” of us. 

Over time, I would run, he would chase and fix and we did that on repeat for 5 years. Lots of criticism and manipulation to keep me around, I didn’t feel like he even actually liked who I was at my core but liked the idea of me being his. My family and friends hated seeing what I became.

I gained a bunch of weight and became super depressed and my nervous system was an absolute wreck. Very triggerable, very unwell. 

6 months ago, we split. I had done quite a bit of research on healing and nervous system regulation and was so done feeling like I was just completely drained in the relationship that is supposed to be my most intimate connection. 

I lost a bunch of weight, started writing again, meditating, eating right, going to the gym and regulating my system through mindfulness and awareness. I feel my mindset and lifestyle has completely shifted and I actually feel like I can see clearly and feel like myself again. 

Now for the kicker - we just reconnected recently. He’s been in therapy, his words and actions are making me feel more seen, understood and valued than ever before. I don’t wanna be a broken record and be like “this time feels different” because I can’t even count how many times I’ve said that. But thus far, he’s been 1000 times more patient with me as far as  making sure I’m ok with reconnecting, he’s constantly speaking to my value as a woman and I can tell he’s truly taking the time to understand me when I’m explaining how I feel to him (something he didn’t do before), he’s validating me and what feels even safer, is he’s leading me through my big emotions. He understands my attachment style and is putting in effort to make sure I feel safe even if that means running for 10 minutes when something makes me feel uneasy. I feel like he’s making space for me in ways he didn’t before and in return it feels like it’s opening doors for me to heal. I’ve been much more willing to communicate and acknowledge ways I need to grow or things I’m doing wrong and I feel like I’m being led into a phase of healing I’ve never seen in partnership. He just feels so much more mature and healed and aware. When problems are coming up, we are pausing and working THROUGH them in a way we never have. We meeting in the middle like it’s us against the issue vs us against each-other like we did in the past. On top of it all, my son is so happy he’s back in our lives. 

I’m feeling nervous to even tell my family and friends, they care so much for me and they’ve watched me run in loops with this man. I’m also fearful that there is manipulation happening and he’s just doing/saying all of this until I’m comfortable and then things will go back to how they were. I’m trying my best to keep my eyes clear but in the moment it’s easy to be blinded by how much you care for someone. 

*** I just want to put it out there too that there was never any cheating or physical abuse in our relationship*** our toxicity was on both ends and we were always so wrapped up in our own emotion that we didn’t make time for the other persons.  he would never lay a hand on me and I’ve always felt very very physically safe with him, it was emotionally that I didn’t feel safe.

How do I end the relationship?,"I, 15F, have been in a talking stage with 15M, for about seven months, and I’m scared and don’t know how to end it. He initially reached out to me over Instagram, because he wanted to get to know me, as we did go to the same school. This was about in October and we had a solid relationship until about December. Something about me, is that I really prioritise my time and I don’t like getting interrupted during that time, so around that time, every time hed message me I’ll get super annoyed and I just didn’t really want to reply— additionally I am someone who doesn’t text often so I’m not used to texting a lot or having extensive conversations online.

In late December, I gave him a long text clearly explaining my reasonings and thanking him for the time together and everything. I should also add, we were also really scared of each other- like talking in real life so we never really talked during our talking stage during that time excluding one or two small interactions. The other worst part is this is about three days after he had sent me a long text confessing his feelings and his hopes for our relationship in the future.

Fast forward to about April, and I hear that he still likes me, and honestly I still miss him at the time as well, so we started talking. A month later in March, we’ve been talking since then, and also our birthdays were both in May. So for his birthday, I got him a burr basket and just around last week, we finally had the longest interaction, and the first time we went out together into the CBD- where he also gave me my late birthday gift. The problem arises is that if I was to give another paragraph again, it’ll be the second time, and it’s also very abrupt and sudden just like last time, as I haven’t really changed my style of talking, im not dry, and I’m still regularly texting him. I would like to emphasise again, how awkward it would be to send another paragraph on ending things ,because of how sudden and abrupt it was. It’d be completely out of the blue for him- again. I don’t want to be in a relationship which I’m forcing myself to be in, nor do I want to be leading someone on and being fake, so what is the best course of action I should take, or how should I deal with this? Sorry bad grammar, its pretty late rn. 
TLDR: So how do I end a talkingstage without making it awkward due to past experiences with the person?

Husband too close to co-worker during postpartum period?,"I’m going to try and keep this as brief as possible but some detail is needed for context.

TLDR:

Husband daily messaging attractive female co-worker for months when I was struggling on maternity leave alone with a newborn, after I’d previously raised concerns about her. 18 months have passed and still can’t trust/forgive. 

Full post:

My husband (34M) and I (34F) work for the same company (in very different areas of the business) and have a two year old. We’ve been together going on 9 years and married for almost 4. I’d say we’ve had a fairly happy, close relationship aside from this issue other than typical relationship bickering and some differences which periodically rear their heads. 

However, 18 months ago, when I was 6 months postpartum and on maternity leave, I found out my husband had been communicating heavily with a female co-worker in his area who he used to manage. She’s around 5 years younger, attractive, unmarried, no kids, a boyfriend she seems not very interested in and successful in her career (significantly more senior in the business than myself and in the same role as my husband). 

To this day, I still do not know the full extent of their relationship but I do know they exchanged messages on the work system most days (often for a lot of the day) for several months until I found out, during the period after we had our baby. My husband was primarily working from home during this time so he’d be messaging her upstairs around doing his work whilst I was downstairs in the house, really quite struggling, alone with a very demanding newborn that we had various particular challenges with. 

I only had opportunity to skim small portions of the messages but the chats were mostly day to day chit chat, confiding in one another about work matters or annoyances, mildly flirtatious humour but I didn’t see anything particularly worrying as far as confessing feelings, no criticism of each of their relationships etc. But like I say, I only read a small proportion of it all and given his demeanour when showing me the messages and a comment he made that ‘I would be upset if I read them’, my assumption is there was stuff lurking in there that may have been worse.

When this all came out, it also transpired that he had been deleting her name from his list of work chats to hide it from me, should I have looked at his computer (as the messages themselves can’t be deleted). 

A key point here is that I’d raised questions/concerns about his relationship with this girl a few times over the course of around two years prior to me finding out the above. I’d previously asked if they message etc and he’d essentially said no. My concerns were prompted by behaviour I’d witnessed with my own eyes (which I was only privy too because, as above, we work for the same company and therefore both attend some big events) consisting of her being a big drinker who becomes very tactile when drunk - albeit, with a lot of men, but that included my husband. I could also just ‘sense’ an atmosphere between them that hinted to me there were some feelings on one or both sides. Some frostiness from her towards me. There’d be some subtle behaviour changes from him that I’d thought may link to her, including: seeming to maybe be paying more attention to his appearance when she would be in the office, seeming never to miss a night out when she’d be there and often not inviting me along, continuing to have regular diarised catch-ups with her at work despite no longer being necessary for work reasons, my husband always having headphones on for meetings at home so I couldn’t hear anything. He has good explanations for all of this/would say its coincidental or I was reading into things. 

My husband maintains strongly to this day that he was only ever friends with this girl. He refuses to accept any feelings were held. I absolutely cannot believe this for one second on the basis of everything I know. Why would he be willing to repeatedly lie to me and risk our relationship when we’ve just had a child for some ‘friend’? He alleges his secrecy was because he knew I’d unfairly react about him having a female friend if I found out given what I’d asked about her previously. He alleges nothing more ever happened. 

After I found out, he massively reduced communication with her (from what I understand) but was still having periodic unnecessary catch ups (which he said was bc it would seem odd and cause trouble for him to cancel them) until I raised it didn’t feel fair, and would still hang out a little at the odd work event or chat in the office. He left the company recently so I believe all communication has now stopped. 

The problem is, 18 months on, I just can’t get over it.  I don’t believe he has been honest with me about the nature of the relationship since I found out about this, which perpetuates my lack of trust and has made it harder to move on from. Our lives have been back to normal from about a week after this all happened, although with periodic conversations about it when I can’t help myself but communicate its on my mind. But I just cannot accept that he would do this when I was at my most vulnerable with our new baby after I’d said so many times previously that I was worried about her and he’d told me I was being silly. Even if nothing ever physically came of it. I can’t shake a sense of not being emotionally safe with him and not being able to trust him. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to rebuild trust and move on from something like this? 

It’s worth saying, my husband does have a lot going for him: is very attractive, funny, confident, intelligent and also happens to earn a lot of money, which primarily funds our lifestyle. Obviously none of this is enough if hes not also, and more importantly, kind and trustworthy, however I really don’t want to break up our family whilst we have young child(ren) if avoidable.

"I [31F] want deeper conversations, but my partner [34M] only makes small talk.","My [31F] relationship with my boyfriend [34M] of seven months feels emotionally surface-level. Most of our conversations feel like small talk, and whenever I try to go deeper, it feels like I hit a wall. I care about him a lot — he’s kind, thoughtful, intelligent, and an animal lover like me — but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s missing.

This is one of the healthiest relationships I’ve had in terms of consistency and stability. There’s no drama, no mind games. But there’s also no real passion or emotional intimacy. I haven’t been in many relationships, so maybe this is just how most of them are? Still, half a year in, I feel like there should be more emotional depth — real conversations about what moves us, inspires us, challenges us. Instead, it feels like we’re stuck on the surface.

I know my boyfriend’s favorite food and color, but I don’t know what truly drives him. I don’t know what keeps him up at night or lights him up inside. I wish I could be okay with staying in the shallow end, talking about errands and weather and work — but I crave depth. I want to talk about art, spirituality, inner worlds.

I’ve tried to initiate those conversations, but his responses are often short or vague, and I’m left carrying the weight of trying to connect.

TL;DR My relationships lacks depth. 

Am I asking for something unrealistic?

I think my partner (32M) lost interest in me (28F),"This is gonna be a long one, so buckle up..

I met my partner in 2022 at work, we’ve been good colleagues but I was always into him and thought I would ask him out, cause why not. He thought I had a boyfriend which is why he has never approached me. Since our first date, we’ve been unseparable. We were doing everything together, worked the same shift at work so we basically had same schedules. For year and a half, I felt with him like I am on drugs. The kind of love and affection that people see in movies, not in real life. I was so in love with how he treated me, how he looked at me, how he was always interested in me. If I wanted a necklace, he suprised me with it. I talked about apple watch, and in 2 weeks I got it.. But not only the material stuff, his whole attention was on me. Long story short, a perfect relationship. He also has a 10 year old son, who he has every second weekend and those weekends were spent going on trips, and adventures with his son. I was very open to this, was welcoming of his son eventhough I do not have any experience with kids. And I think this is why my bf was so into me, because he could trust me being around his kid. I always wanted my own family one day, but I’ve accepted this at that time. I went on holiday in May 2023, and when I came back we had a conversation about moving into a bigger place, as a reason he told me his son needs more space (we live in a studio flat). I got a little scared and took a step back from this, I didn’t see us moving for his son who is with us every other weekend. My logic was I want to save more money and buy a house instead of rushing to move because his son needs more space. I’ve explained to him my reasonings why I don’t think this is a good idea, we’ve agreed to wait and that was that. I’ve changed my job, and at this new workplace I mainly work with men. He has also changed his job, now he is a truck driver and he is tramping (gone from monday to friday). Since he knew I am working with men, he was very jealous and wanted to know every single detail of my day which I’ve tried to share, however sometimes there is not much to say. As this is an office environment, there were days where I sat down in front of a screen, listened to music and nothing else happened. He was expecting a long conversation but I just didn’t have much to say. And this started a lot of arguments between us, and even when I shared something he found a reason to argue. For example I went to get a coffee with my male colleague, as we were getting more coffees for everyone and I shared this with my partner, of course it was a big argument cause I went for a coffee with a guy from work.. And this was happening daily, a lot of silly arguments, about his son, about my work.. But he still loved me. He would call me few times a day, flirt with me, etc.

Fast forward to February 2025, when he told me he doesnt love me anymore. Of course I panicked and cried and begged, told him let’s give us some time, maybe he will realise he misses me and loves me but he was 100% he lost his feelings. The phonecalls stopped, the interest.. I went on holiday end of March 2025, and when I came back he said he wants to try again, but ever since then, he has been acting weird, when we are intimate it’s not passionate, he doesn’t look at me the same, no more flirting.. I would do anything for this guy which is why I have changed my way of thinking and accepted his son again, as I realised this is the LOML and my soulmate. He keeps telling me he loves me but everytime I tell him I am missing something, he just says he doesn’t want drama and makes an argument. I dont know what to do, I love him but he acts like he doesn’t love me. He said the more I expect the less I will get. When I tell him I would like to feel wanted by him calling me once a day, he says “if I don’t have anything to say, I won’t call you. I am trying my best but it that’s not enough, I can’t help you.” Is there a way to make him be obsessed with me again, like before? 

I know past is the past, but we’ve both said this was our best relationship. I am willing to make him happy, give him the fairytale we once had. Why is it so hard for him to love me the same?


TL;DR, My partner loved me so much before, only saw me, basically was obsessed with me. After period of arguing over his 10 yo son who lives with his ex, and my new job with male colleagues, he told me he doesnt love me. After a month he tells me he loves me again, but it just hasn’t been the same. Is there a way to recover the spark?",2,1kyc2a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kyc2a8/i_think_my_partner_32m_lost_interest_in_me_28f/
I don’t know if I can see a future past my GF’s depression,"Me (M22) and my GF(F21) have been together for just over 2 years. When we first got together things were great. We had and still have loads in common, same music taste, enjoy the same kind of social events and just generally get on really well. The issues started to arise about a year and a half ago. She had been open about struggles with depression in the past from the get go, as was I, but about 7months in her mental state really took a turn. She stopped wanting to go out and started to rely on me for more and more. It came to a point (I’m not sure when exactly) where I found myself more as her live in carer than her boyfriend. I was responsible for cooking, cleaning, and making sure she was happy. While this was going on I really struggled trying to find work in her area which began to take a toll on my confidence. Eventually though I did managed to find myself a job local to her… until i started to miss shifts because of her mental breakdowns which would make me scared to leave her on her own. This basically culminated in me deciding that we needed a break to figure some things out. Cut to now… and I have no idea what to do. I know that as things are this isn’t a sustainable relationship, but she knows that too and I do think she’s trying to change. I love her and I keep trying to think of how we can go forward but I don’t know if I’m just being optimistic or if my being with her is just enabling her depressed lifestyle. Honestly any advice would be appreciated at this point.

Hi! i’m F18 my partner is M20 we are long distance, when i first got with him he was smoking weed. i gave him the option to be with me or smoke, he chose me.

It’s now been 10 weeks since the last time i caught him & i do feel like he is going to stop this time. He has promised it was the last time and he not going to do it again( has said this twice now)-am i silly to believe this? all of his friends smoke which also makes it really hard.

What should I do about my boyfriend?,"Hi, this is the situation I am (F30) in with my boyfriend (M31) with 11 months of relationship.

I've been dating my boyfriend for almost a year, I love him but I feel unhappy and miserable. Since Christmas my feelings have been hurt every now and then. I'm a person who appreciates little details but perceives every little change on connection, how he talks to me, manners, etc. He didn't have anything for me on Christmas and lied saying my present was coming but never arrived any package. On February 14th we had dinner together, fine. I waited until my birthday and he gave me a little sanrio plush that it wasn't my fav character, which is so obvious if you pay 5% of attention. His excuse is that he has no money, but I have never saw him without his tobacco or maria since I know him.
 I saw him expending money on videogames and then he tells me he doesn't want to go on a walk because ""he has no money for a coffee""... 

He's being rejecting me for months and only having relations like on Christmas or my birthday.  Saying I'm not the problem, that he doesn't feel well and has no desire... That makes me feel so bad and insecure with myself. 

Says he loves me but hardly talks to me via WhatsApp or see each other on weekends even he does anything at all during the week. I see him depressed but he doesn't want to talk to me about it and rejects going to therapy. His words doesn't resemble with his actions and viceversa. I feel so lost, angry and sad because after talking about it several times he doesn't change. He doesn't take care of me as I do.


I would love to see him as he was at the beginning or a better version of himself. What should I do to get that outcome? Should I wait any longer?

(30F) Feeling emotionally disconnected in my relationship (30M). How do we rebuild from here?,"I’ve been with my fiancé for years now, and we have a child together. Lately, I’ve been feeling deeply unseen and emotionally neglected in our relationship. Physical intimacy has been great, and he’s very loving in that way, but the emotional intimacy, the quiet presence, the affection just to connect (not lead to sex), has been really missing.

My love language is emotional connection. And when that’s not present, I don’t just feel “a little off.” I feel unimportant and not prioritised. 

There have been a string of moments that built up. He didn’t kiss me goodbye like he usually does. He didn’t pull me in for a hug or cuddle even when we had the chance. When we got home, he took a phone call from a female coworker and took it in the bathroom instead of taking a moment with me, which felt especially disconnecting. These things may sound small, but to me, they felt like big emotional absences.

When he came out, I told him that I didn’t feel like a priority anymore. He apologised and said he heard me. He ended up feeling horrible about what he’d done, mentioned that even if I forgive him, he may not be able to forgive himself. Some other things were said and that was the end. Until a couple of days later, he asked if I’d be okay with him going to the gym with that same female coworker. I said no. It hurt that I even had to say it, especially after everything I had just opened up about.

Then not long ago, I asked him, “Is she worth losing me over?” That question completely shattered him. I could see it broke something open in him. He said no, absolutely not, but now I don’t know where we go from here. I feel like I’ve been breaking for a while, and he’s starting to realise it.

For a bit more context, she’s new to the place. Only been around a few months. He’s been helping her adjust as he’s been there for years. According to him, they just hit it off and get along really well. They talk outside of work a lot. Apparently send memes, jokes and what not to each other. Not that I’ve ever seen any of these conversations. 

I’m tired of feeling like I’m begging to be seen. I don’t want to be possessive or controlling. I just want to feel chosen, loved in my own language, and emotionally safe.

How do we rebuild emotional intimacy when it feels like the cracks have already formed? Has anyone come back from a dynamic like this? Any advice or insight would really help.

tl;dr:
I love my fiancé, but I feel emotionally neglected despite good physical intimacy. After multiple moments where I didn’t feel prioritised, I told him I felt disconnected. When he asked about going to the gym with the same female coworker he had originally put before me, I asked if she was worth losing me over, and it shattered him. Now I’m not sure how to move forward or rebuild emotional safety.

Uncomfortable with Friendship (48m) (44f),"In a Long Distance relationship and she has a ""Friend"" but what really got me was a stupid comment she made. She Said to me ""We both told each other that we could only be friends."" when I asked her about their friendship. 

I mean yes I may be insecure or not reading g the situation correctly but I have never told a female friend of which I do have a few that ""we can only be friends"" 

They chat daily morning and evenings. 

I feel that it is totally unnecessary to say that sentence unless there was movement or signs of things moving in that direction. I have never had to utter those words and have always respected the boundaries of friendship. It keeps replaying in my head and it concerns me that there was a need to say ""we can only be friends"" 

I haven't raised the issue but her ""friend"" also wrote some romantic songs for her. She is a singer and writes poems. He is also in the music industry composes music. The ""friendship"" started when he set her words to music. But I found out he wrote multiple songs for or about her. (16 songs) 

I am uncomfortable with this ""friendship"" because of a simple sentence that we clearly told one another we can only be friends.

My gut is telling me something is off.

TL;DR My singer gf has a composer songwriter friend. The text mornings and evenings. She can habe friends I don't have a problem with that. But she casually said ""We both told one another we can only be friends"" I never had a need to say that sentence to a female friend because I know the boundaries of friendship. Also found out he wrote 16 songs for her or about her? 

Edit:
Over the weekend she went to a show where her Friend was working as Sound Engineer. I was ignored for hours. She apologized for ignoring me while hanging out with her ""friend"". Blocked me on all her socials. Last message I received was I am sorry.

Wife 33F occasionally passive aggressive towards me 35M. Some suggestions please.,"I [35/M] have been married for 2 years to my wife [33/F].

I’d say that our marriage is generally good. Of course there has been arguments which we mostly resolve. Sometimes we get on each others nerves, though that is perhaps normal and giving way to each other is reasonable to prevent a big fight from small issue. Conversely, there have been times where I’ve stood my ground and she apologises.

However, passive aggressive behaviour generally irks me. My wife is occasionally pass-ag (not too frequently). There are times I’ve felt the urge to stand up to her behaviour, although I stayed quiet. Other times, she is quite respectful. I’d say 85-90% respectful/polite and 10-15% pass-ag/sarcastic.

What approach is reasonable?

I love him to bits and he’s my bestfriend I couldn’t imagine being with anyone else. However lately I’ve been missing being young and having that excitement and lust when first starting a relationship. Being in the chase and not being able to keep your hands off eachother. Getting excited when they message etc. I have been watching a lot of enemy to lovers type movies and young adult romance movies so maybe it’s my own fault. I’ve told him that I want more passion more excitement etc. I even suggested going to a bar, acting like strangers and picking eachother up but he said that was a stupid idea and he didn’t want to do that. We are trying for another baby so we are having plenty of sex but it’s boring and routine I want spicy. It makes me want to go back in time and relive those moments with him.

Me (20f) and my girlfriend (20f) have trouble having conversations.,"I am not sure what the issue is, but whenever we talk, we basically just ask each other how our days went, and that's mostly it. conversation doesn't really go farther. Sometimes it does, but that's usually if we're showing stuff to each other or playing a game so we have something to talk about, but even then conversations pretty much always stay on the things themselves. 

Sometimes in conversations with others we get to other topics, and she does speak on those, and I end up learning things about her that I haven't in our 10 months of dating (and about a year before that of friendship)

A few times we have done those ""50 questions to ask your girlfriend/boyfriend/whatever"" things and that does at least give us a way to talk about a variety of things, but it rarely sparks a deeper conversation that goes beyond the prompt.

When we first started dating, I figured it would get better over time, that we would learn to communicate or have more opportunities to talk as we went on, and I eventually forgot that it was a concern. However recently she herself brought it up as an issue, and since then I can't stop worrying about it.

I have a weird thing in relationships, where issues like this make me really anxious and upset. I worry that they are insurmountable and spell the end of the relationship, which I know is an overreaction, but that's how anxiety is.

She has said it could be her, that she has a tendency to be a dry texter and is bad at conversations, but I don't really think that's the case, since she talks more with other people and has a lot of friends. I do think it could be the combination of both of us being bad at conversation though. It's just frustrating :/

"I don’t have feelings for my girlfriend anymore, but she still has feelings for me.","Hello Reddit community, I came to talk about my relationship with my girlfriend. I'm really confused on what to do and I really need some advice. So, I'm in high school. My Girlfriend is an awesome person who is always nice and always supportive. We've been dating for about 9-10 months. This is an incredibly long time, and I've been grateful to have a girlfriend for this long. There has been a long going problem that I've never tried fixing because I never wanted to hurt her feelings.

For a while now, I’ve started to lose interest in dating her. Don’t get me wrong, and I’ll say it again, she is an amazing person, but I’ll tell you why I’m starting to lose interest. I’ve never told her, but me and my girlfriend have a different sense of humor. I never want to sound selfish, but, I do like a girl who can make me laugh, and my girlfriend has just never made me genuinely laugh. It’s always been a forced laugh because I don’t want her to feel bad. When I asked her to first start dating me, it was a confusing time, we had a class together, she liked the same movie I liked, she gave me some snacks in that class, I watched the movie sitting next to her one time. But then all of my friends continued and continued pressuring me on to ask her to date me. And I will say, I was happy that I got to start dating someone, but I didn’t really get to have a lot of time thinking about wanting to ask her to be my girlfriend. It just kinda happened because I asked her after my football game when I had a good amount of energy and pressure from my friends to ask her to be my girlfriend.

She is a nice person, and I would like to have a girlfriend. It’s just, I don’t know if I waited way too long to tell her that I’m just not feeling in love with her after she thinks that I’m totally in love with her. It’s gotten to the point where, and I know this is bad, I don’t respond to her FaceTimes on purpose. I’m just confused and lost. There have been moments at my school with other girls where they say things that are funny to me and make me genuinely laugh and have a good time when I’m hanging out with everybody. This may sound like a picky thing, but a lot of times I’m the one who has to start the conversation with my girlfriend. If it’s starting to get quiet, or we’re walking together, I have to make a funny remark to spark the convo. 

There wasn’t a time we’re I was thinking about her in my sleep or thinking about her all day. It just kinda happened you could say. My girlfriend means a lot to me, and she is a a very nice and supportive person, but I’m just not feeling in love, you know? And I feel like being deeply in love with your girlfriend is the reason you have a relationship. Right? Also, she has a ton of friends at my school, and some of her friends, (the ones who gossip a lot), I feel like would spread a bad word about me around the school if I broke up with her. They would say stuff like, “Why would you break up with her? She’s such an amazing person” or “she is such a kind and supportive person, why would you break up with her”? And they would say that stuff trying to make me look like a horrible person. And I know that I should never be scared about people tryna make me look like I’m a horrible person and spreading rumors. But, I like to be friends with everybody, and I don't want to be looked at as a jerk, You know? 

I’m 16, so I got a long road ahead. But any input from all you guys on Reddit would be really helpful and appreciated. I would love to be friends with her if we weren’t dating, but I just don’t know what to do. There’s probably more stuff I could say I’m confused about, but I’ll leave it at that. I’m pretty lost when it comes to relationships, so let me know what you guys think about my situation. Thanks for reading all of this!

Am I (23M) overreacting with my (23F) girlfriend? Have been together for a little over a year.,"What is some advice? My girlfriend and I have been together for some time now. We have an amazing time together going on a lot date nights, movie dates, exploring nature. 


Recently I can tell that she has been really upset about something because she has told me so. When I ask what’s wrong or if she is okay she says that she does not want to talk about it. She also says that she doesn’t want to think about it. This makes me overthink a ton because I obviously want to respect her but at the same time I can’t help but wonder what is wrong. 


She assures me that it has nothing to do with me or us but rather something she would rather handle by herself. She has always been hard on herself at times which is why I guess I am kind of asking for advice on this because I don’t want to ask her about it and make her upset. She is also not the type of person who would cheat and I know that a lot of people probably do say that but if she did I would know because our best friends are all couples in the same friend group as us.

My girlfriend has been upset about something and does not want to share with me. I want to respect her space and be here in anyway I can for her. She has struggled with always being hard on herself.

I can give some more details, but the things they said during this DTR have aligned with what i know about their last relationship(s) and why they ended/what they’ve discovered about themselves through them. 

I am crazy about them, and they have definitely reciprocated my feelings. I feel understood and they make me feel special. I can honestly say that they are a rare type of connection i have only had with another couple of people in my life. 

So my question is this: is the “not ready to commit right now” a true excuse in your experience? Are there friends (who eventually turned into couples) out there who simply waited for one person to be ready before actually committing to being in a relationship? Or is this most always a sign that things will not go any further? Do I at least somewhat pull back from our relationship to guard my heart?

tl;dr person i have been seeing hit me with the “I am not ready to commit to a romantic relationship card.” I was told there are romantic feelings and that they love our relationship, they just aren’t in a place to give all of themselves to dating me. Is there hope for us to eventually date or should I protect my heart and take a step back?",2,1ky113a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ky113a/is_there_hope/
I 19F need help with how I feel about my online friend 18M,"So we're been friends since late 2020 so we've been around for almost 5 years and recently I have begun to help weird every time we talk or call one another and I have no idea what's happening, this started around maybe a month ago and we were on a video call with each other and there was just something about him that made me feel really weird and his just seemed so nice and this has never happened before so I have no idea what's wrong with me and I can't help but want to talk to him every waking moment now and just listen to him talk so I could really use some one explaining what's going on with me

My boyfriend’s mental health is tearing me down,"I (23f) and my (25m) boyfriend have been in a relationship for about 8 months now. We truly thought we were twin flames. A deep connection that’s undeniable.

However, we both have mental health issues. I have been doing better, but he has been falling off the rails a bit with increasingly stressful loads put on him.

He has an extremely avoidant attachment style and I have an extremely anxious attachment style but I have completely dropped it to tend to him.

He has avoidant “discarded” me about 3-4 times before where out of nowhere, he claims we have been fighting a lot (we used to, but I swore to do better and I have) and he doesn’t want me anymore. 24 hours will pass and he will regret it.

He said recently he has never felt anything this real and it scares him to get too close. He pushes people away and isolates himself.

I have tried to stay strong, even with my abandonment wound ripped wide open each time he gets down.

I have catered to him emotionally and even physically, making sure he eats. Every day, he sits on the couch on the phone or staring at a wall.

He is expressing some suicidal thoughts but tells me if I say anything to anyone, he will never speak to me again. He claims I am making his mental health worse when I asked if I was.

He claims he doesn’t care about anything anymore. I have spent countless hours giving him space, being a listening ear, a shoulder to cry on, etc.

I’m starting to become exhausted and miserable myself. Being told he doesn’t want me, him getting snappy when I pry about his feelings, being the keeper of his dark thoughts..

The life and joy has been sucked completely out of him and our relationship. He stopped planning dates, bringing me flowers. He used to be so goofy and silly and now he’s completely vacant.

He has struggled with mental health for a very long time. I am trying so hard to be there for him but his answer to almost everything is “i don’t care.” “so what?” “i don’t know.”

I offered to pay for his therapy and medicine. He refuses any professional or personal help.

I’m scared he will try something stupid.

I have spent entire days giving him space but at some point I feel obligated to try and talk. 

Do I just give him space? Do I leave? I’m so lost, i’m trying so hard to be a strong willed and supportive girlfriend. I’m trying to be his rock but I’m thinking I should just let him be.

Any advice or similar experiences would be amazing.

TL;DR! my boyfriend’s depression is having an effect on us and me. ",11,1kxznfl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxznfl/my_boyfriends_mental_health_is_tearing_me_down/
F20 needs advice after broken trust because of her girlfriend F19,"TL;DR:
F20 in a relationship with F19 for 8 months. After my grandma died, I developed anxiety and became emotionally dependent on my girlfriend. She broke up with me because she felt smothered, then admitted she secretly met with her ex twice behind my back using fake excuses. After some emotional talks and her blocking him, we got back together. Now I’m struggling with trust issues and fear she might lie again. Her mom even helped her hide the meetups. I love her, but I’m unsure how to move forward.
How can we rebuild trust? Is it normal to question my feelings?
--------------------

Heyy Guys!

I really need an advice rn. Soo: Im F20 and Im in a relationship with F19. We are 8 months together. Our relationship was full with passion and love, until something happened.

My Grandma died 3 weeks ago. And I've never been the same since then. I got trust Issues and was scared to lose my girlfriend. I wanted to spend every minute with her because It felt like I was only doing good when she was around. But.. We all know.. This isnt good for a relationship. 
A week after my Grandma died, a friend of hers texted her ""Heyy your ex wants me to tell you, He wants to talk with you"". I said ""No"" Immediatly because I was jealous. They came 3 times back together and I thought he would try something and wants her back. She told me she won't text him. You should remember it.

Then my Problems got bigger and bigger until last sunday. She broke up with me because I was too much. She didnt have freetime or alonetime. She felt like in a cage with me. And she told me.. She met him behind my back. Two times. One time when she told me she meets a friend, which was okay for me. And the other time we were talking and she was like: She has to go soon because her Mum wants to go shopping with her. But when she told me that It was no big Deal for me. Of course I was hurt, but then it was okay. I was focused on improving myself. I wanted her back. And so.. she texted me tuesday morning (3am). She missed me and wanted me there. She was crying and didnt sleep the night. She was going to the burial with me to be my Support on this day. After the burial we talked and she told me she still loves me. So we came back together.

Now to the Point with her Ex: She told me he tried to get her back as soon as she told him we broke up. He didnt even cared about her feelings. She told him she is hurt because of the break up but he just asked everyday if he gets a chance. And soo she told me she wants to quit contact with him. She did it in the evening and showed me how she blocked him. 

But now to the main reason why I text here: 
She lied to me because she was scared of my reaction. She knows im scared of her meeting up with him because I dont trust him (And now I know Im right). But thats not the problem. The problem is that she created a good Story or a good excuse to meet up with him. She told me I can join her and her friend when they meet up if its okay for her. But then a day before she told me its not okay for her. I was fine with it. And when she was ""with her mum"", I saw random that I cant see her location. I gave her my GPS on Snap map a while ago and she did it too. But now I couldnt see it. I asked her about it and she lied to me that someone texted her her Adress and she turned it off because of it. But the craziest part is.. Her mother told her to do it. She supported her to meet up with her ex behind my back.

And now how do I feel? I feel betrayed and Im scared she will do it again. I love her, thats why we back together. But I cannot trust her yet. She tries to reassure me that she won't do it again but there was some more times when she broke my trust. But there it wasnt as Bad as now. And I just dont know how to handle this situation.

So my questions are: Do you guys have any advice for me? How can we build our trust again? And is it normal to doubt my feelings and our relationship?

Let me know. I would be thankful.

"I (30F) want to end a friendship with a distant, emotionally unstable friend from college (35F) who keeps asking me for help getting her a job","When I was in college 10 years ago, I became really tight with my roommate, Marybeth. Sometimes we’d hang out with her best friend, Seth; Seth’s girlfriend, Juniper; and Juniper’s friend, Annie, who had already  graduated but came to visit a lot.

Fast forward a decade, and all of us had moved to a big city nearby. I was in grad school, so I was pretty busy, but I made time to hang out with Marybeth as often as I could. I would see the rest when my schedule allowed. Marybeth and I sometimes talked about how Annie made us uncomfortable, because she trauma-dumped constantly. Annie especially liked to trauma-dump with me because both of us dealt with stalkers. I understood her pain, but I didn’t want to talk about what had happened to me all the time.

Things started to get more intense when Annie decided she wanted to be in the same field as me. Throughout adulthood, Annie has had jobs for a few months here and there, but it ends with her getting fired. She’s trained as a teacher and is good at it, she just loses steam or doesn’t show up. Neither of us had jobs during the beginning of the pandemic, so we put together a virtual camp for tweens who wanted to write. It ended up going okay, though I had to project-manage Annie a lot. Then I got a job offer and didn’t have time anymore. My career field is a blend of tech and creative writing and requires a lot of niche skills. Annie decided she also wanted to join this field when our camp finished, and I encouraged her, but also told her that it would take a lot of work/time/training for her to build up a portfolio. She did do a few spec projects, but none of them went anywhere.

A few years ago, I joined a project that required me to move across the country, which suited me because I couldn’t afford the city any longer (it’s one of the most expensive in the world). Every few months, Annie would text me about jobs, asking if I knew anyone at this or that company. I would usually tell her “no,” even if I did. One of our mutual friends recommended her for a job at his company, and she again lasted a few months before she was placed on a PIP and then fired. I didn’t want to be responsible for the same fiasco. After awhile, Annie’s requests started to really wear on me, and I mostly stopped responding to her.

Here’s the thing. Annie does not need to work because her husband, Matteo, is rich. They live in a high-rise in one of the most expensive neighborhoods of my former city and recently took a weeks-long trip to one of the costliest countries in the world. It’s always been grating to hear Annie complain about not having a job and being broke because she doesn't have to worry about where she'll live. For her, working is a choice, not a necessity. I get that she feels bad with no creative outlet, but she is \*not\* broke.

Last weekend was Marybeth’s wedding, so I went back to the city with my partner. We were seated with Marybeth’s best friend, Seth, and Annie. It’s been a rough year for both Seth and Annie. Seth and his college girlfriend Juniper had gotten married, but then they divorced after Juniper cheated. Seth got every single friend in the divorce, even Annie (Juniper's best friend), which is probably some kind of record. Seth has been struggling, and Annie has stepped up to help, though, from what Marybeth's said, it's mostly Annie and Seth mutually trauma-dumping about Juniper. Marybeth asked if it would be chill to seat me with them, since they didn’t know many other people, and I said sure.

It was not super chill. Annie kept trying to talk to me about how down she was over losing Juniper and not having a job. She didn’t ask me for help getting work this time, but she did talk about how ugly and fat she is, which didn’t make me feel great because we have a similar body type. (Also, Annie is conventionally attractive.) As Annie got drunker, she asked if I was mad at her and that’s why I didn’t answer her messages. She kept repeating that I was a really special friend and she wanted to keep me in her life. We literally hadn’t seen each other for years :/  I kept telling her that we could talk about it after the wedding.

I told her I'd call on Saturday. Tbh, I don’t know if I even should call. I’m thinking I should maybe send her a long text explaining that we have different perspectives on this friendship, and that I wish her the best and I’m so, so glad she has been supportive of Seth, but I feel like she spent years seeing me as a career pathway. Do you think this is the right approach?

TL;DR: college acquaintance says our friendship is really special to her, but I feel like she just wants me for my career connections and I can’t keep doing this.",23,1kxxm9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxxm9z/i_30f_want_to_end_a_friendship_with_a_distant/
He [27M] said he might not stay with me[23F] if I can’t have children. Now I’m questioning everything.,"The situation: I [23F] have been with my boyfriend [27M] for almost 3 years. The last year has been long-distance, but we’ve been planning for me to move to London after I finish university so we can start our life together. We’re both excited about the future—living together, building a life, and eventually having a family. At least, that’s what I thought.

The other night, I asked him a hypothetical question: “If I couldn’t have children, would you still want to be with me?” His answer? He’s not sure, because he really wants biological children of his own.

We’re both healthy as far as we know, and we’re not planning to start a family anytime soon. But his answer hit me hard. Being a mom is something I have a strong desire for, probably even stronger than his. I realized that I would most likely stay with him if the situation were reversed. I’d be open to IVF, adoption. Because to me, being with him matters more than genetics.

This made me step back and ask: Are we equally committed? I’m getting ready to uproot my entire life—leave behind family, friends, and career opportunities—to be with him in a city I wouldn’t have chosen otherwise. That already feels like a huge personal sacrifice. But now I’m wondering… what if something goes wrong? What if I make this move and he walks away when life throws us a curveball? 

It was honestly an eye-opener. I love him deeply. But if I’m willing to go all in, shouldn’t he be willing to do the same?


The outcome I want:
 I want to continue my life with him, but I need the reassurance that my sacrifices won’t be wasted.

When and how should I approach a future conversation about my concerns? 

TL;DR:
Been with my boyfriend for 3 years, long-distance for the past year. Planning to move to London to live with him soon—a big life and career sacrifice for me. Asked him if he’d still want to be with me if I couldn’t have children. He said he’s not sure because he wants biological kids. Now I’m questioning whether we’re equally committed and if I should be worried about making such a big move for someone who might not stay through tough times. When and how should I approach a future conversation about my concerns?

"I feel like my girlfriend is always looking for reasons to be mad at me, and it's starting to wear me down.","I’m (21M) writing this because I don’t really know what to do anymore, and I just need to get some of this off my chest.

Lately, it feels like my girlfriend (21F) is actively looking for reasons to get annoyed or upset with me. I try to be respectful, caring, and honest with her, but no matter what I do, something seems to always set her off.

One example that really stuck with me was when a girl at school tried to get my Snapchat. I said, “No sorry, I have a girlfriend,” because I didn’t want to be rude. I told my girlfriend about it because I wanted to be transparent, but instead of appreciating the honesty, she got mad at me for saying ""sorry."" I tried to explain over and over that I just didn't want to be mean, but she wouldn’t hear it. She ignored me for days and when we were out in public during that time, she started pushing me randomly when people were nearby and yelling things like, “Stop touching me!” or “Get away creep!” It felt like a joke to her, but it was incredibly humiliating for me. She didn’t seem to care.

Another time, I talked briefly to one of her friends about an assignment we had together. I asked when she thought her part would be done, since mine depended on it. That was it. But when my girlfriend found out, she ghosted me for days. Then I find out she had an 8-hour FaceTime call with one of my friends, someone who clearly has a thing for her and doesnt hide it. When I brought it up, she claimed it was for their school project... but both of them were done with it many days prior, i got that confirmed by their 3rd partner on the project.

She’s made it clear that I shouldn’t interact with her friends at all, fine, I’ve respected that. But she talks and flirts with my friends constantly, especially one guy who everyone knows is a bit nasty and who has openly flirted with her. She clings to him and jokes around with him all the time, and it just feels like a slap in the face. The double standard is crushing.

I don’t know what I’m asking for, maybe just some perspective. Has anyone been in a relationship like this? How do you even know when it’s time to let go?

Thanks for reading if you made it this far. It’s been heavy on my mind for a while.

TL;DR: It’s starting to feel like I’m not allowed to breathe without upsetting her. She gets upset with my for the smallest reasons, there were plenty i didnt write down, trust me. And the worst part is, I still love her so much. But I don’t know if this is healthy. It’s like a loop: she gets annoyed or mad, I get sad and feel unappreciated, and then nothing really gets resolved. I try to show her love, affection, and loyalty every day, but it’s like none of that gets seen.",2,1kxtvbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxtvbd/i_feel_like_my_girlfriend_is_always_looking_for/
Me (37F) and my husband (53M) live with my parents but my husband is moving out due to conflict,"Me (37F) and my husband (53M)  have been married for about 2 years and we live with my parents for financial reasons. We were living on our own but I lost my job last year and my husband is disabled with no income at all. We didn’t have anywhere to go so we moved in with my parents, plus I’m going to start school soon to advance my career and my parents are assisting me with that.

The conflict is my dad (me and him do not have a good relationship), he can be really selfish and has no empathy. My husband puts up with him for the most part but my dad keeps throwing our stuff away without checking with us first and it makes my husband really angry and we have asked my dad to stop but he continues anyway.

My husband was venting to me about it in our room and my mom overheard the conversation and confronted us. Her and my husband had a screaming match over it and basically my husband said he’s going to leave. He has no where to go and talking about living in his truck.

He refuses to talk to me about leaving together because he doesn’t want to ruin my opportunity to go back to school, plus I don’t make enough money to support us. He basically says don’t worry about him but he’s my husband.

We’re in this situation where we’re still married and want to be together but we’ll be living separately for about 3 years.

What should I do? Do I let him move out even though there’s no where for him to go? Do I leave with him and put ourselves in a bad place financially and forget about school? Is anyone else in a similar situation? 

TL;DR: my husband and my mom got into a fight and my husband is moving out with no income and nowhere to go.",0,1kxr50p,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxr50p/me_37f_and_my_husband_53m_live_with_my_parents/
28F feeling resentful about marriage timeline with 27M boyfriend,"Hi everyone - I am a 28F and have been dating my 27M boyfriend for a little over 2.5 years now. We moved in together about 10 months and things have been going great. Apart from the usual couple ups and downs, we have a healthy relationship and share a pet together.

When we first started dating, we very loosely talked about timelines - I told him I wanted to get engaged around year 3 and married by 4 years together. That seemed like a reasonable plan to him at the time as well. Fast forward to now, I brought up a conversation about potentially getting engaged in the fall at our 3 years, and long story short, he feels reluctant. He has some vague feelings about not being ready, wanting to wait till year 4 to get engaged, etc. We got into an argument about it and I ascertained that he has a lot of anxiety about the future and struggles to look ahead and feel excited about the future. I am a huge planner and look forward to milestones in my life, whereas he takes life more “day-by-day”.  There is a chance we might be long distance next year because of our careers, and he mentioned that this gives him sadness and anxiety and he’s just in general not looking towards things changing.

I’ve told him multiple times that I’m not interested in being someone’s long term girlfriend, I want more, I’m excited about being married to him and starting a life together. I also told him that I am not planning on waiting around forever and will end the relationship at some point if marriage isn’t in the picture. After talking a lot, we’ve agreed to be engaged by the end of 2025. Last time we spoke, he said “I’m coming around more to the idea of that” which made me feel bad. Originally I was glad to at least have some reassurance that it was going to happen this year, but now I’m feeling resentful and frustrated and like I pressured him. He’s not brought up engagement ring shopping at all on his own and continues to never bring up the subject. I realized that while I was initially happy that we discussed getting engaged this year, I am starting to get scared that he still might not be ready and I may get some version of a “shut-up ring” on December 31st. I know he loves me and wants to be with me, I trust that he is true about his feelings, but I don’t trust that he is capable of taking the next step. I am scared I am pressuring him into this and that I would feel unsatisfied even if it did happen because it wasnt his own autonomous decision.

I’m starting to feel resentful even in our happy moments together. Whenever we are relaxing or cuddling and he’s telling me how much he’ll miss me when I travel for work, I can’t help but think “you love me and our life but you don’t want to get married.” And it makes me resent him. I’ve been trying to start couples therapy to talk about this but haven’t found an available appointment yet. I really don’t know how to cope with these feelings and I would appreciate any insight or experiences that might be similar.

TLDR: My (28F) boyfriend (27M) of 2.5 years “not ready”/ “coming around to” the idea of engagement this year but I am feeling resentful that he hasn’t taken any steps towards doing so and anxious that I have pressured him and don’t know how to cope",8,1kxq41t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxq41t/28f_feeling_resentful_about_marriage_timeline/
I (19M) do not know how to tell my dad (54M) that I love him.,"Yes, it sounds like a very stupid thing and I also know that I can just tell him that I love him but here is where the problem lies.

I come from a pretty traditional Indian household, and as most asian families, there is never been a stress on telling my mom or dad that I love them. Recently, I worked up the courage to tell my mom that I love her over the phone call and my mom was very happy, she said this was the first time I told her that I love her (She too never really told me that she loves me, but she has this nickname for me and she always showed her love through the way she speaks.). 

I was pretty happy about this and went about my daily life, till I came across an Insta reel which talked about how we spend most of our lives and never tell our parents, in words that we love them. That's when I realized that I never told my dad that I love him but since we come from a traditional family (my dad is pretty open minded), I wonder if its unmanly(?) to tell him that. It sounds crazy, but I genuinely fear that he might not appreciate it.

TL;DR - Due to being brought up In a traditional household, i am scared of telling my dad that I love him",10,1kxodte,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxodte/i_19m_do_not_know_how_to_tell_my_dad_54m_that_i/
Need your thoughts🙏🙏🙏 26F 39M,"I (26F) have a bf (39M)that I’ve been dating for a year and a half now. We’re not planning long term since we have different religions so we know things are not gonna work out. At first he kept chasing me until he made me love him (we were working together) but I left the country and it became long distance relationship. 5 months into the relationship I told him we have to end this bc it’s not going anywhere. He kept saying don’t say this again and we don’t know what the future holds for us and that even if we didn’t end up together we can still enjoy a a few good years together. It doesn’t make sense ik but I fell for that but I was trying not to get too attached because I knew it’s going to end sooner or later. I was back in the country with him for 4 months then I left again (he already knew from the start it’s going to be long distance bc I can’t stay long everytime I go)….

everything was cool until this girl appeared in his life, shes married but going through divorce and she has feelings for my bf (hes the one who told me and he got to know from a mutual friend) I asked him not to hang out with her as it really bothers me and I don’t feel comfortable at allllll esp that I’m not physically present. At first he said ok he’ll stop but he didn’t. She goes to his place and they drink and smoke together. He doesn’t like her thats for sure and he’s been even trying to ghost her and not text her back when she asks him to go over to his place and she was crying to my other friend because she felt like hes ignoring her. So hes not into her whatsoever but his reasoning is that he feels lonely since im not there and he only has 1 close friend thats always busy. He was hiding that they hang out until I found out when she was talking to my friend over the phone about that. But ofc I was suspicious bc of the way he was acting.

Anyway 1 week after this drama he told me he doesn’t wanna be with me anymore bc of sth I did but it was sth sooo stupid, until now I’m not convinced it really annoyed him but my perspective is that he got bored bc I was always questioning him abt that girl bc he was acting weird!!! I’m not paranoid!!! And my doubts came true at the end when I found out they were hanging out almost everyday. Anyway I said ok fine and I stopped texting him at all, like at first I tried to apologize hoping that it really annoyed him but he wasn’t listening and wanted to end things. Then 3 weeks later he called me apologizing and saying I really love and miss you but I was annoyed by you questioning me all the time.

And we’re back together but I’m still so hurt. I feel like he’s never been genuine with me from the way he handled the situation, the way he was talking to me calling me hypocrite and liar (only during our last fight….he never treated me this way before), telling that gurl I don’t see a future with her (it’s true that we have no future but lately hes been telling me that he’ll try to fix everything so that we can get married bc he loves me and he never said that we have no future so by him saying that and to that gurl made me feel tht he doesn’t care abt me at alll and it feels like hes talking shit abt me) also my friend told me that this girl told her that they kissed and hugged I’m soooo hurt. N.B: I have some issues that will hold me from going to where he is for the next maybe 9 months and maybe more so it’s making things harder….QUESTION: why did he start talking to me again??? Hes been ghosting her and she calls my friend and cries to her bc of that….what tf is happening?? I need analysis to that….hes calling me everyday now exactly like before as if nothing happened….but I’m 100% sure she still comes over and they hang out but he still hides it…why??? Is this normal bc we’re long distance so it’s fine that he hangs out with her a lot???? I’m so hurt and feel unappreciated

TL;DR: hes been hanging out with another girl bc we’re long distance….does that justify it??",2,1kxo58p,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxo58p/need_your_thoughts_26f_39m/
Me m31 and my girlfriend f37. What is the best approach in this situation?," I m31 girlfriend f37 6 months together 

So I am going to try and word it as good and especially as neutral as I can in order to have a outsider their view view that is unbiased on the situation.

I have been in a relationship for 6 months now.
I met this girl online, was so insanely attracted to her that I couldn't resist striking up conversation.

I ended up following her from one online platform to a other, than we exchanged numbers and a month and half later we met up.
This girl is a extremely unique one of a kind woman.

She's has been in a institution for people with mental health problems and addiction, she's been in and out these institutions for about half her life.
She's also been in mental hospitals and therapy for almost her entire life too.

The reason?
She was heavily abused, sexually, pscycally, emotionally from childhood on.
By her mother no less.
As a survival mechanism she developed psychopathic, sociopathic, and narcissistic tendencies.

She has after leaving the environment of her abuser(mother)
Developt a nasty habit of manipulating everyone around her to get her way, or out of a sadistic trait to hurt people.

This behavior has led her to destroy the 2 men she had a serious relationship with and who were genuinely in love with her and did nothing but their best to see her happy.
She also ended up with a alcohol addiction that nearly ended up killing her.

The past 5 years of her life she decided to go for a different approach.
She no longer hid the fact that she didn't feel empathy or any remorse, and she stopped manipulating the people close to her because this behavior lead to her being so lonely in the end, she almost threw herself in front of a train.

In fact she did, but people saw and cops were involved to get her of the rails before she was successful.
The other institute what she called home before the one she lives now.
Was hell, no other way to describe it.
Only money was on the minds of the people who were in charge there.

For over 1,5 years she decided that she finally wanted to explore her sexuality, and not just play the part in a relationship, or be forced by anyone.
This is the reason why I met her on pornhub and not a more normal social media platform.

She said to me, even before meeting up with me.
That I would be the first guy in her life she wanted to have sex with, she even was looking forward to this from before we met.
And this is true, how much effort it took for her to get comfortable enough with me to go for it tells me she was 100% honest about this.

Because of her unique situation she has the right to a extremely early pension, but because of her age and lack of work years.
This money is only 500€ per month.
Ever since I first met up with her, we've had one BIG issue in our relationship.

That being how much we saw each other per month.
She was only able to do so because of her mental health (her institution allows her to go out and stay the weekend every week) twice per month.
I have always been very vocal about me wanting to see her weekly, after much arguing and fighting I finally gave in to her pace of 2 times per month, but she did promise me that when we reached half a year of relationship that every week would become a thing.

Half a year of relationship is where we are at now, and I am seeing her less and less than ever before.

Seeing how little money she has, and how much I wanted her to be happy.
I got her things of her Amazon wishlist, for around a good 100€ per month.
I knew that I was getting her stuff she could have never dreamed of having without my help.
And i very much love making her happy.
I even got her a playstation 5 not that long ago, as well as paying some bills so that she was finally debt free for the first time in years

My living conditions are not super comfortable for a woman, my toilet is broken and showering at my house is impossible, and in winter I have to use electric heaters to warm up.
But I have always taken her to a nearby gas station for using the toilet.
And showering is possible at my aunt's place who lives a few hundred meters away.
She even said that I did so much for her to feel at ease in my room that this was very doable for her, she always refuses to shower at my aunt because she doesn't really like being there. Even if I can make it so we don't spend any minute longer than we need there.

Over the course of these 6 months, I have taken us to hotels near the border( she lives in Germany, I live Belgium)
I'm actively looking for a new place on my own ( this is something that I wanted to do before meeting her, but I have been putting in effort for speeding this up because I want to have a life together with her)

Last time I saw her was 2 weeks ago, this weekend was one of the only ones we've had that was really bad.
Eversince I have been begging her to finally meet up with me weekly, I completely dropped this for months.

For me having the stability and security of seeing the woman i love weekly is extremely important to me.
She only ever argues with me about the fact that I did get mad a few times because of her ignoring this one thing I asked of her.
She keeps telling me that one day she will come over weekly.

I have gotten into contact with professional mental health practicers because I was doing bad(still far from perfect)
I did this for a huge part because of her asking me.
I'm speeding up moving out on my own also for her, and our future together.
I have made several appointments with different medical people because she asked this from me.

I have by now spend a fortune on her, I mean every time we see it's all on my paycheck she doesn't have any money.
The hotels, the food, even me getting her one or two packages of tobacco for when she goes back home to get her through the rest of the month.
The amounts of things I bought her from Amazon is insane, the playstation 5 is the most expensive one, but certainly far from all I got her.

I never expected anything in return, I just wanted her to be happy.
At this point in time, I really need for her to provide me with the security of her being here for me in the weekend.
I know my situation is not super fun, but I am changing this, especially fast for her!

She used her extensive knowledge of psychology to help me out with personal insecurities and I will forever be thankful for that.

But the last 6 weeks I saw her twice, this is even so much less than what was agreed in the start.
The two times we saw each other in the past 6 weeks I had one specific request.
I was having a very high libido and asked her to make those weekends be more focused on sex, I obviously want so much more from her, I love her!

But I asked because this was never a problem before, the 2 times we saw each other I got almost nothing from her despite me asking this clearly and her being up for a weekend like this in the past.

Not only am I getting to see her less and less, sometimes when we had agreed to see a few weeks in a row, something last minute came up on Friday while I was already super excited and had prepared everything I could to have a great time together.
She fell off the map until Sunday evening coming back with a explanation that was super vague and made no sense.

The past few days especially I have been pouring my heart and soul into trying to communicate with her.
Her replies are always something like that she didn't even knew that I was struggling so much because of the lack of security of seeing her, her explaining that she too needed to work on our relationship, but so do I, and If I work on certain things about myself it would great because I could suddenly deal better with her not coming my way on the things that I want from her.
And some other of her answers are, yes I understand you, but I am not going to even make a compromise for you.

The past 2 days I have been writing entire novels and leaving very long voice messages about how much she means to me and how much I need for her to be here in the weekend.
Today she even kinda made a joke about my points.

Yesterday she said she was not responsible for me feeling lonely in the weekends she isn't with me.
I disagree with this, I don't think a partner should be responsible for your happiness because too many factors involved, but loneliness is something that I expect a partner to help with.

She keeps going on and on about the times I got angry with her ignoring my requests and still gives me nothing to count on things being different in the future.

She told me about how she destroyed good guys in her past, she said she is different now.

I'm at the end of what I am able to do for her.
Her situation is so much of a hassle that most guys would not even bother for just sex.

I'm doing all I can to offer her a normal life outside of mental institutions again.
I'm completely drained of energy and ideas for what I can still do.
I'm so at the end of what I can that I am about to fall into very deep mental issues myself.

I didn't only help her with money and gifts, I didn't only spent so much time energy and effort into making her feel special and beautiful (she has major self-image issues)
I didn't only help her get a chance at having a normal sexlife.
I did ALL of this and more without even blinking a eye.

I only ask for her to finally see me in the weekends, I don't mind if her institution is going to a basketball game, or they're throwing a birthday party for a other resident and her therefore not seeing me.

I feel hurt when she calls of a weekend with me to spend the entire time playing games on her phone that are aimed at childeren, she calls this self-care.
These games she plays when we are together too, and I don't mind this.

But she rather does that, mixes in texting and sexting with me, and tells me how much she would have rather be with me then alone in her room!!

I am burning out because of this!
I want a outsider their view, and I hope you could ""choose"" her side so I can still try and make it work and not feel played like a idiot .


Very current update, she just told me she is being committed to a mental hospital because of Crisis and stability.
She has no idea for how long she'll stay there, but she did tell me she still wants to work on our relationship....
I'm confused as hell

TLDR
Been in a relationship with a complicated woman for 6 months and she still doesn't want to see me weekly.

I (18F) feel like I’m being annoying and uninteresting to my boyfriend (19F) over text,"Me and my boyfriend used to be able to text for like three hours straight before we got into a relationship which happened a month ago. Ever since we became girlfriend and boyfriend we don’t really text as often. He’ll send me a couple of texts and then I’ll get back to him over the course of a couple of hours, in which he gives short responses. I don’t like this style of texting. It makes me feel like I’m annoying him because he takes so long to respond and I end up really missing him. It makes me feel like he doesn’t miss me in return. It makes me feel like he doesn’t want to talk to me about anything even tho I would listen to him talk about anything. Now I’m panicking because he hasn’t replied in a few hours and I feel like I’m annoying him so much. He’s not this way in person, he’s really sweet and caring, just an inconsistent texter. My ocd will play tricks on my mind and make situations out to be worse than they really are but I don’t know if that’s happening here. I just really miss my boyfriend but I can’t text him a lot now without feeling this way. Helpful advice on how to communicate my feelings to him better would be really appreciated.

I (26f) am wracked with guilt over vacation time situation. How can I get over this so I can actually enjoy my vacation?,"TL;DR - my partner of 5 years (27m) and I (26f) agreed on vacation dates for two separate trips. I got the days wrong on both requiring changing time off work and asking family to move their trip dates to accommodate. Meanwhile partner is all upset over the stress of it and it still not being perfectly the way we planned. Can’t make everyone happy, but how can I forgive myself?


This just feels totally fucked and I need advice on how to forgive myself and move on here. Basically we planned two trips to the shore in June. Family has a house we can use. I thought we confirmed the dates but I guess I got it mixed up in my mind and missed a day for one and took off work for the entirely wrong week on the other, also missed a day on the weeklong one. So when my partner heard this he got extremely upset because these vacations are “all he’s working for” right now. Which is understandable. I said I would fix it. I work a job where it’s difficult to get time off, so I had to go back to my employers and beg nicely to be off on an extra day where they really needed me. That worked out without too much trouble, but I still feel shitty making them rearrange their schedules for me.

Next, our weeklong vacation (that I planned for the wrong week) ended up then overlapping with the only time my dad can get to the house in June. He planned his trip after I already claimed my dates though. Partner is upset about this because it doesn’t feel like a vacation with a parent around. Okay fine. I ask my dad to change his departure time, which he does but not so that it fully avoids overlap. So now I feel like everyone is losing. I feel like a total POS. Dad probably feels like I hate him and don’t want to see him but I just want to have my own time like we planned. Partner is still upset because the beginning of the vacation is tainted by another person being present. I likely cant switch to being off work to the correct week we originally planned on going to avoid overlap because of aforementioned difficulty for my employers being able to cover me. But I did ask to find out if it’s possible, which makes me feel even worse because I already did this once with the other trip. 

I feel like such shit about all this I am afraid I won’t even be able to enjoy the trips because of everything I had to fuck up to get there. I want to cry and stay home and never try to go anywhere or take off work ever again. Help.

My boyfriend (25M) keeps having small outbursts with me (25F),"TL;DR: My bf (25M) of one year has been having outbursts at me when he is stressed out. As they add up it is emotionally taxing for me. I want to figure out how to work through this with him because I do love him & he is extremely kind outside of the outbursts.  

My bf and I have been together a little over a year. I want to preface by saying he is a very kind person and I do love him. I want to figure out how to approach this with him and work it through. There have been multiple instances over the last year where he is either overstimulated or stressed out and if i say something wrong in these moments he gets snippy with me. One of the first times I pointed it out, we had a gathering at his mom’s house for a game night and he was upset he was losing a game. I cheered on his mom and told him he could do .. xyz .. to better his chances and he abruptly in a raised voice said “stop talking to me”. I was shocked because I couldn’t believe he’d take a tone like that with me especially infront of his family. I felt extremely embarrassed and just stopped talking the rest of the night. I brought up to him the way I felt and he apologized profusely saying he just gets competitive and caught up in games. 

There have been multiple instances where he abruptly just has a mood switch but I’ve brushed them off. Recently it was my birthday and we were driving in a city. I am originally from a big city and am used to the driving & I suggested I drive but he insisted so I let him. I accidentally told him to get in the wrong lane and he cut someone off to go where I told him and had to get back over. He said “ugh now I look like an asshole”. I told him it’s fine everyone makes a wrong turn here and there and everyone is an asshole to someone. I did make a following comment that he was bumper to bumper with another car because I was worried about them braking hard and us rear ending them. After I made the comment he snapped at me and yelled “can you just let me drive?” I was very upset and my emotions got the best of me so i started tearing up because I was sad it was my birthday and he was ruining my mood & I just stopped talking. He did apologize later that day. 

We’ve had multiple conversations about how I don’t want to be talked to that way by my partner and he always says he’s working on himself and trying. 

I do appreciate the apologies but just saying sorry after being mean to me is not cutting it for me. He is working on himself in therapy and I am proud that he is but I don’t want to be on the receiving end of his outbursts. It’s getting harder for me to move past them even after apologies. I’m not sure how to bring this up without discrediting his work in therapy. ",2,1kxnl3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxnl3u/my_boyfriend_25m_keeps_having_small_outbursts/
Question/Advice Please,"My boyfriend(25M) and I (23F) have been together for almost a year. Sometimes he says “I need to have complete control over everything at all times or else I get upset.” Through our relationship I never could see him as controlling, however being almost a year together i’ve really started to learn that he tries to be very emotionally manipulative with getting me to do things. I recently had a colposcopy done (NOT A COLONOSCOPY). We had plans to go watch a movie, I didn’t think about how I would feel after the procedure. I was taking my dog outside to use the bathroom (morning after procedure) I started feeling a lot of pain and muscle weakness. I went to my BF and said “I don’t think I’m going to be able to go to the movies with you I just started feeling like sh*t from the procedure.” He pulled his t shirt over his head and got mad. He was upset because he had already bought the tickets and said he couldn’t get a refund. I apologized and said I will pay him the money back. Then, I went to take a hot shower to try and relieve some of the pain I was having. After the shower, I went in our room to get into comfy clothes. He comes in and says,  “Are you almost ready? We have to be there in like 20min.”  I said, “I told you how I was feeling and I really don’t think I can go to the movies right now.” I suggested for him to go watch the movie so he would just lose the money for my ticket, as he wanted to see this movie as much as I did. He got very upset, left our room and I heard him punch something in the kitchen. I laid down and about 30min later he comes back in our room and says, “I was able to get my money back.” I said “That’s great, I’m sorry because I didn’t expect to be in this much discomfort.” He didn’t say much so we brushed it off and  proceeded on with the day. This is just one of the times this type of situation has happened. It happens often, is this him emotionally trying to control/manipulate me? How can I put an end to him doing this to me? 


TL;DR —
I (23F) feel as if my BF (25M) of almost a year is very manipulative/controlling, emotionally with me. He plays with my feelings and emotions very often. Above is one of the situations that happened recently. How do I put an end to him doing this to me?

Taking it slow or is he stringing me along?,"TL;DR: trying to reconcile a second time with my ex boyfriend. He doesnt know what he wants and wants to take it slow and actively refusing to make any future plans. I'm trying to figure out if he's stringing me along. No kissing or sex but lots of sentimental moments, consistent communication, and dates

I (41F) dated my boyfriend (36M) for less than a year and we had planned to spend our lives together. He moved across the country to be closer to me and bought some property to build on. At a certain point he became very cold and distant because he began resenting me as he fixed up his property and I began detaching over his change of personality. We broke up and didnt speak for a couple of months and during this time he tried very hard to get in contact with me. Finally we tried to reconcile but I was angered by him reconnecting with his ex girlfriend while we were apart and their growing emotional connection as we were trying to patch things up. So we quickly ended things again. I thought about my anger and realized I was coming from a place of control and jealousy. He has been apologetic, and is now in therapy. We have forgiven each other. I love him and want to continue our path together. I contacted him three weeks later and he was at my door in an instant. We are being very cautious and he has explicitly stated that he hasn't made up his mind about what he wants, either to jump back in or move on. He has refused to kiss me or have sex because he wants to ""take it slow"", but we have been physically loving and close without hesitation. It's been two weeks since we've been back in contact and have been on several dates, expressed our love for each other, and made very near future plans. We have also mutually agreed to be exclusive. He keeps saying we need to stay in the present and refuses to plan anything too far in the future with me. Our communication is open and consistent. He has asked me to be patient with him while we navigate our relationship, but everything seems so vague and uncertain on his part. It's been wonderful taking things slow but I am missing the passionate aspect of our relationship- kissing and sex. He knows this and is very adamant that it is because he wants to let it ""happen organically"" Can anyone shed light on this? Is he stringing me along or is this typically of a guarded man dipping his toe back into a relationship with someone he describes as his ""favorite person"" whom he loves unconditionally.",1,1kxmcav,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxmcav/taking_it_slow_or_is_he_stringing_me_along/

"Moving out of how with my partner, she's disappeared","Hey everyone,

I'm in a weird situation, would love some input. My partner 40 (F) and I have ended our relationships a few months ago. It's a very brutal breakup, with a lot of hurt feelings. I am living in the house, and she has moved out. She hasn't lived here for 3 months.

Our lease is up, and I've chosen to move into a new place. We lived here for 4 years and I just can't live in this house anymore-- want to start out fresh. I told her in email and verbally that she has until May 30th to remove her things from the house. She still has a bed, a dresser, and some clothing.

She is emotionally unstable in some ways, and tends to be controlling. She hasn't spoken to me in over 2 weeks. Obviously, I'm on edge because when is she coming to get her things? I think it's part of her controlling nature. Also, I cannot just throw her things to the curb legally. I'll have to get a storage unit and move the things for 14 days to the unit to protect myself legally (if she doesn't get her things.)

I know that if I email her, she'll just ignore the email but at this point I really just wish she could communicate. Any advice would be great, thanks

TLDR: my ex 40 F and I are moving out of the home we share. I've been living her, she has not for 3 months. She still has some things left over and 4 days to get them out but won't communicate.

"33M 28F How do I support my girlfriend when she feels emotionally numb? I’m trying to change for her, not lose her.","Hello everyone

Please help, I would really appreciate the help. Have been together for 6 months about to go into 7. Dating for 5 months going into 6. 

I truly love this women. I’m trying to figure out how to support my girlfriend the right way without smothering her, overwhelming her, or making her feel like she has to be okay. A few days ago, we had a really honest conversation. She told me she’s been feeling emotionally numb. That she’s lost her spark. And that even when we’re together, sometimes she still feels alone. That hit hard—not because I took it personally, but because I love her and I don’t want her to feel like that, especially not with me. I’m not trying to fix her. I’m not trying to force anything. I just want to be steady, present, and supportive. I know I have my own flaws and I really.

Last night we FaceTimed before bed and she said “I love you” multiple times before falling asleep. Today she was joking with me and laughing, and hearing that laugh meant the world to me. It reminded me that the connection is still there, even if things feel off. I know she’s drained. I can feel it. And I’ve been doing these from the beginning taking her out on dates when I can, writing her love letters, bringing her flowers just because. I don’t do those things to fix her mood. I do them because I want her to feel loved.

This situation made me realize how much I need to grow. I don’t want to love her with empty words or promises I want to love her with action. I want to change as a man. I want to be more emotionally available. I want to be more thoughtful, more intentional, more grounded. I don’t want to lose her, and I’m not just saying that. I’m doing the inner work.

* How do I keep showing up in a way that gives her peace, not pressure?
* How can I stay emotionally connected to her when she’s feeling so disconnected from herself?
* What are the quiet things that matter most to someone who’s going through emotional numbness?

If you have ever been on either side of this feeling numb yourself, or loving someone who is your advice means a lot.

I’m not here to fix her. I genuinely love this women and I know as a man I need to step up but I am unsure of what to do and how to do it. I know I need to be more present when spending time with her. I really want this women to feel like she on top of the world and truly want her to glow with love and not make her feel like her spark is lost in herself because shes trying to keep the peace in the relationship.

Please help, I really would appreciate the help. I am afraid to lose this women and I really want to change and truly show her with actions that I love her. I know I am loyal to her and keep my heart loyal to her and always give assurances and communicate, as well as tell her she has a safe space to talk about her feelings.

I know I need to be more present when we spend time together. I really dont want her to feel alone when we are together. Always try to listen to her and stop trying to give solutions to problems. Im afraid to lose this women.

**TL;DR:**  
My girlfriend recently told me she feels emotionally numb and disconnected—even when we’re together. I love her deeply and I’ve been doing what I can (dates, flowers, love letters) to show her she’s loved. But I know that’s not enough. I want to grow as a man—be more present, more grounded, and support her with real actions, not just words. I don’t want to smother her or pressure her. I just want to be steady and give her peace. I’m scared of losing her, and I’m asking for advice on how to love her the right way through this.",2,1kxlds0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxlds0/33m_28f_how_do_i_support_my_girlfriend_when_she/
Do I give him a second chance?,"This is gonna be a long one but here’s the context to the situation first:

My (25f) fiancé (26m) told me that he’s not attracted to me and doesn’t love me anymore. We have been together for 4 years, lived together for 3, and everything had been great until a few months back. He stopped doing little things for me like giving me a kiss before leaving for work (something he had done every morning since we started dating) and when I asked him about it the first time he said he forgot the past few mornings because he’s been stressed about work etc. Then when I brought it up again, he told me he felt like it was too much effort. At this point, I was concerned because this was very out of character for him. I honestly thought he was falling into a depression and wrote off a lot of what was going on because we had three years of him being considerate and loving. There were definitely signs in the past few months, but I didn’t think it was because he didn’t love me anymore.

He started acting hyper critical towards me, commenting on everything I did wrong, telling me everything I do is wrong, etc. It hit a boiling point when we were driving home from his family’s and he looked like he was going to be sick (he ended up having a severe migraine which we found out after I took him to the hospital). The reason I took him to the hospital is because he started swearing at me on the way home (something he had never done before). It scared me. I told the nurses and doctors about it, thinking it was a symptom of some kind of medical emergency. Later, on the drive home, he told me to stop telling people that he swore at me because they would think he was abusive. I told him that I wouldn’t stop telling people and if it wasn’t a symptom then it was not okay and if he ever did that again I would leave him. In retrospect, that’s when he started to become way more distant. Nothing I did was good enough. If I cooked supper, it was overdone, if I cleaned the house, I forgot to fold a blanket, I couldn’t do something good without him commenting on something that wasn’t quite right. I confronted him about this and he was apologetic but it started back up again pretty soon after.

Finally, I sat him down and asked what was going on. He acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about. I went through everything that had been going on and he just sat there in silence. I asked him if he had any kind of response or reasoning behind this and he just said “I dunno”. I should have taken this as his answer, but I genuinely thought he had something going on. I just wanted to support him. After a long discussion, we went through things that he needed to change and things that I could do to support him. We also decided to go camping as a way to try to rekindle things.

We went camping this past weekend and it was fun. Something was off about him all weekend but when I asked, he told me it was nothing and he was just trying to enjoy himself. So I left it. I didn’t push and just tried to have a nice time. Once we got back and had finished cleaning up, he came and sat down on the couch next to me. He asked me what I thought about camping and I told him I enjoyed myself but that something seemed off about him. That’s when he told me that he wasn’t sure about us. He told me he’s not attracted to me anymore and he’s not sure if he loves me. A very long, very emotional conversation ensued where I kept asking him to clarify things and he kept answering “I dunno”. He told me he hasn’t been attracted to me in a while and that I’m not sexy enough. I haven’t gained any weight or really changed anything about myself physically and so I asked him what about me he was no longer attracted to and he couldn’t give me an answer. He told me there was just something missing. Finally, I asked him if he still loved me and he said he didn’t think so. I looked and him and said “so things are over?” And he said “yeah”. He slept on the couch that night and left for work early. 

I spent the entire next day completely broken. I have never felt that kind of hurt before. I sobbed all day and couldn’t get myself to stop. I spent the day with family and they helped me get my thoughts together. We planned out what I would say and do for pretty much any scenario. The only way I would let myself give him a chance is if he apologized profusely, initiated going to therapy and recognized everything wrong with himself and what he did. All of this without any prompting from me. Well, that’s exactly what happened and more. I had never seen him so broken. 
He told me that everything he said was a mistake and not true. That he was afraid of marriage and didn’t know how to confront that. He told me he was looking for a therapist that specialized in family trauma and attachment styles and that he would do anything for a chance to try and fix things. I told him that we could try to fix things but that I had no guarantee that I’d be able to move past what happened. That only time would tell. I told him the wedding was still off, that we were no longer engaged, and that the relationship is taking a major step back. That we’re not just starting up where we left off. 

Now I’m torn. I love him, but I also recognize that love isn’t enough. I do believe that this was a major wake up for him and that he will follow through with everything he said. But I’m just so embarrassed. I’m cancelling things like my wedding dress and the venue and I feel so lost. I want things to work out, but either way I’m embarrassed about a failed engagement and failed wedding. If we hadn’t been engaged, this wouldn’t be so public and I think it would have been a lot easier to deal with. But my family, his family, and friends all know about this and that’s what I hate the most. I hate having my personal life and struggles out there for everyone to judge. The worst part for me is that the embarrassment is there whether we work things out or not. So how the hell do I come back from this?

TLDR: He broke up with me, realized it was a mistake and is now making steps to fix everything. The wedding is off and I’m embarrassed.",3,1kxl9gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxl9gx/do_i_give_him_a_second_chance/
"My(36m) wife(35f) and my mother(50ishF) got into a heated argument, how do navigate this?","My wife and mother have always had a rocky relationship, but have always been able to manage, my wife in particular feels that my mom has talked about her behind her back and my mom supposedly doesn’t know what she did to get the cold shoulder from my wife. 

Last episode was About 3-4 months ago we were going out and we needed someone to stay with the kids (14m, 12f, 2m) and I suggested we should leave them with my mom, that way she gets to hangout with them, since she doesn’t really spend much time with them. My wife tried to counter that and try to make it so that they would stay with her parents, but I stood my ground and they were gonna stay with my mom. The day came and I drop them off early at my moms house, so we could get ready, and as we are almost leaving she tells me she doesn’t feel ok living the youngest one with my mom because she won’t know how to take care of him, and I said that it wouldn’t be a big deal, anyways she calls my mom to talk to her about this and basically ends up saying she’s going to pick them up and basically hangs up on her abruptly, I got pretty much pissed at that, but decided to play it cool cuz I didn’t want to mess up the day, we picked up the kids and my mother definitely felt disrespected by her for hanging up the phone in such a manner (but because I walked in and got the kids we didn’t really get to discuss it.

After that they weren’t speaking much to the point where my mom ended up blocking her on WhatsApp, and my wife found out that she was blocked, and then also found out that my daughter was blocked (my daughter being blocked is kinda not clear on how that happened). And basically I had to hear it again about how my mother was a nightmare and how she hated us and just a bunch of demeaning things about my mother, and I tried to stay neutral and said that it was a reaction based on what had happened ( I didn’t know a 100% but I kinda figured) and that we should all have a conversation about it and get down to the bottom of the issue between her and my mother, because I didn’t want to feel like my mother wouldn’t be accept in my house if she wanted to come over or whatever.

Fast forward to Memorial Day weekend, one of my aunts was in town and since I had just bought my house a couple of months ago I wanted her to come see it, and she was staying at my moms house, so I ended up inviting my mother over also, my wife knew about it because I communicated to her that I wanted to bring them over, and she was fine with it. My mother on the other hand was a bit skeptical about coming over but at the end decided to come.

My wife was cool with it and even went and bought some crackers and cheese to serve and some coffee. We get there and walk in and everything seemed to be cordial, but I could tell my wife was not too comfortable with this visit not from my aunt but from my mother, she seem hesitant and didn’t want to sit with us and was a little tense, some time goes by I’m showing my aunt the house and we go back to the living room and my wife is kinda just floating around and not really sitting or interacting, just kinda awkward, by then I had noticed my daughter had not said hi to my mom or aunt so I go to her room and asked her to come and say hi to them, she basically refused and then my wife came over and in front of everyone basically asked me what was wrong and that she felt like the mood was tense, that if there was something going on I should tell her, kinda in a way so others can hear, and I basically said that no one was saying anything and that if she had a problem she could just say it, and she said that maybe my mother had a problem and so then I asked my mother in front of everyone if she had a problem and my mother replied that she didn’t and that moment was settled.

Well after a little while my wife was sitting next to me and my mother was sitting across, and so there was silence and I felt like I had to try and get them talking about the issue without picking sides just talk it out to start from scratch, and when I did that, and I started pointing out some of the things that they have both done to make the issue bigger then all hell broke loose and they started arguing with each other, it got pretty intense, my mother mentioned her hanging up the phone and my wife mentioned something to the effect of her being deceiving, and basically it was a mess, nothing came of it, they disrespected each other some more, I tried to mediate but it didn’t work, by the end I took my mother home, and it hurt me to see the 2 of the most important women in my life not get along with each other, so now I’m just here thinking of if I should even stay with my wife (not running to my mothers arms because I know she has as much fault and I’m a grown man) or walk away just cuz I can’t stand the idea of not being able to have my kids see their grandmother or have her over when we have get togethers, maybe I’m just thinking about it too much, maybe I should just look forward to a live where my mother has very limited access to my kids.

Tl;dr: my wife and mother got into a heated argument over Memorial Day weekend over the way they treat each other, I tried to meditate but it didn’t work, im contemplating braking it off with my wife because I feel she is being way too condescending against my mother, but I also know my mother has some fault in this too, and now I’m contemplating weather if I should move out altogether and start from scratch.

How do I explain to my friend that I can’t hangout due to strict parents,"TLDR: I tell my friend I can’t hangout due to lack of freedom at home she disregards and tells me I’m an adult and can do whatever I want and it frustrates me 

My friend (F19) and I (F19) are both back home from college. Ever since I was a kid, I was never able to go out whenever I was at my parents house, and I didn’t have the same freedom I had when I was at college. When I was at college, I was able to do whatever I wanted because I had my own freedom, but my friend doesn’t understand that once you’re back at home, you have to respect your parents rules. Whenever I tell her no to things, she pressures me into going, and her reasoning is, “You’re an adult they can’t tell you what to do.” I know better than to rebel against my parents like that because I respect their rules. Just recently, I got into a car crash at night, and it makes me a bit scared to drive at night, and my parents also don’t want me to drive at night for a while due to me getting into the crash. My friend wants to make plans again but at night, and I told her that I can’t go due to being back with my parents and my fear of driving at night. She disregarded these concerns by saying, “Girl, you’re 19, and everyone has gotten into a crash it’s not that deep.” It’s so frustrating because whenever I try to explain, she always does this. How can I explain to her that when you have strict parents and you’re back at their house, you follow their rules because it’s not your house?",1,1kxixw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxixw5/how_do_i_explain_to_my_friend_that_i_cant_hangout/
My Fiancé (M27) does not love me anymore because his mother (F59) is sick?," The start of our relationship was not easy, it took 5 months for us to be able to have sex because he was very shy at first and then he had to get surgery on his penis. That created some tension, but after those 5 months our relationship was heaven. I truly felt love, I felt energetic, safe, calm... It became the healthy relationship I've always dreamt of. We were a team, our days were filled with support, sweet thoughts and kisses. I've never been that happy. Unfortunately this lasted only for four months. As his mother got sick, he started being distant, which felt normal as first, after all his mother was sick and the only important thing was to take care of her. I made sure I was being helpful, I still cook healthy meals for his mother, I text her frequently, researched doctors and the best exercises to keep her moving. However, she is a piece of work ( very controlling, jealous of me, very possessive) and I did vent about her to my Fiancé... She would criticise my cooking, constantly telling me what to do. She told her ADULT son he couldn't go on a trip with me because he had to work. Worst thing that happened is that I left my suitcase at her house (my fiancé was still living with her) and she went through my clothes and washed some of them. That felt like a violation of my privacy, so I asked my Fiancé to move in together, after all he had already proposed to me because things were just amazing. I assume that this ""request"" and the occasional venting convinced him that his mother and I were antagonists and that he had to choose between us. So he started defending his mother aggressively, for example he shouted at me when I asked if he could tell his mother not to call more than once when we are on holidays together. But we were still looking for apartments, he feel in love with this one apartment and convinced me to rent it with him. So we did. After that he started telling me I forced him to move in together, that he feels suffocated and can never see his friends (I have never once told him not to see his friends). He eventually realised that I never forced him to do anything, but he stopped being thoughtful and kind, stopped touching me and making plans with me. he acts like he does not care, sometimes he does not even look at me. It hurts like hell because I felt in bones like he was the one for me and he is not the same man anymore. I am still supporting him, I am never leaving his side, I take good care of him and his mother by giving them all the love I have. Please, I you found yourself in similar situation, I need your advice. I feel like I lost him and I am loosing myself as well.

How should I (32M) bring up delayed ejaculation issues with my girlfriend (31F),"As the title implies, I’ve been with my partner a few months. I’ve always had issues ejaculating whilst having penetrative sex. I can honestly say she is the only one I’ve ever been able to do this with, and I also ejaculate when she gives me a blowjob.

However I do sometimes struggle to ejaculate, which has nothing whatsoever to do with her. I think I just get anxious about it because I’ve struggled with it for so long and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. Sometimes I fake an orgasm/ejaculation, and I’m worried she may have noticed, we don’t use condoms anymore. She hasn’t given any signs necessarily that she has noticed, but the fear is there nonetheless.

I won’t fake orgasm again, but I have a few questions: women, what are the chances that she’ll have noticed? And more generally, is there a way I can broach this topic whilst reassuring her that it has nothing to do with her? Would be grateful for any advice or any experiences anyone would be willing to share with me.

TL;DR: I have delayed ejaculation issues, I’m in a brilliant relationship and the sex is great but how can I broach my issues honestly with her whilst ensuring she doesn’t feel like it’s anything to do with her.",0,1kxhv5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxhv5t/how_should_i_32m_bring_up_delayed_ejaculation/
What can I (28M) do to fall back in love with my (F28) partner?,"TLDR: can I fix things after falling out of love with my long term partner?


My partner and I have together for eight years. I have previously made a post talking about some doubts I've been having in the relationship. 

I have since discussed these issues with my partner and she was very upset to hear that I'm so unsure about a lot of our relationship. 

Something else that I've since realized is that I think I may have fallen out of love with partner. This may be linked to my depression (I struggle a lot with anhedonia and don't enjoy life much). I feel very emotionally numb and while I still care and worry for her on a mental level I feel like I'm a bit checked out emotionally. 

I've made a commitment to her and we've been together such a long time, I want to try and do everything I can to fix things. Maybe it's a hopeless cause but I think what we have is too good to give up on easily.

I'd like to get advice on if there's any strategies/resources/frameworks I can use to try and rekindle affection and fall back in love with my partner?

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO (PLEASE HELP ME),"Hi I am 14y female and my 'friend' is a 14y female aswell, and my bestie also just happens to be a 14y female aswell. I've only really known my 'friend' for 4 weeks but i've been besties with my bestie for 2 years.

So basically me and my bestie wanted to enter a commerce competition together which has a prize of $1000. Me and her work REALLY WELL together and have gotten outstanding results in the past. I asked her if she wanted to do it and she agreed!!!!!!

Now moving on to my 'friend' let's call her Ari. First of all Ari's personality is so bad and she has a superiority complex so no one ever wants to partner or group with her in group projects. Secondly she is known for trying to push her way into making groups of 3 when the teacher says make partners by crying, after she does this she doesnt do any work and makes the group fail. q

Now when the teacher announced the competition i immediatly texted my bestie asking to pair when Ari walks over and asks who i'm working with, I saw i'm working with my bestie and she says ""Let's make a group of 3"" and i reply with ""me and my bestie just really want to work together on this one"" she says ""NO NO NO it's ok we will be great together"" then she texts my bestie if she can join my group. I then tell her that i really dont want her in my group and she gets super mad and decides to start trash talking me to a friend who's she bullied in a previous group task. This friend is friends with me and doesnt like Ari so it's ok. On the train my crush waves at me and i wave back from across the carrige. i move closer to him and sit next to Ari she looks mad and we just sit in silence. 

SHE'S STILL TRYING TO JOIN ME AND MY BESTIE PLS HELPPPPPP

"I (24F) have lost interest in sex with my partner (28M), but I still find him attractive and love being close to him","Hi Reddit,
My boyfriend (28M) and I (24F) have been together for several years. Lately, I’ve noticed that I’ve completely lost interest in sex. It just doesn’t feel exciting or fulfilling anymore, more like something I go along with, but don’t actively desire.

What’s confusing is that I am still very attracted to him. I think he’s really good-looking, and I love being close to him, kissing, cuddling, touching, just spending time together. There’s still affection and emotional connection. I don’t feel like we’ve fallen out of love or anything.

It also isn’t about wanting someone else, I don’t feel turned on by anyone, and I don’t fantasize about being with other people. It’s not about boredom or missing excitement. It’s more like the whole idea of sex just doesn’t feel appealing to me anymore. I miss wanting it, but the desire just isn’t there.

I haven’t talked to him about this in detail yet, because I don’t want him to feel rejected or unattractive, which he isn’t. But I’m starting to feel confused and a bit worried. I don’t want this to create distance between us, but I also don’t know how to “fix” something I don’t understand.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? Is this just a phase, or something deeper? I’d really appreciate hearing others' perspectives or advice.

Thanks in advance. 💬

I (26F) have realized I am only friends with college roommate (26F) out of pity and do not want to continue this relationship.,"TL;DR: I am friends with someone out of pity and I need advice on how to properly end this relationship. 

My college roommate and I became friends out of circumstance. She was my roommate and we majored in the same field. She was familiar and I felt comfortable around her. As time went on, we remained friends but now 5 years out of college, I am realizing we have nothing in common and I am only friends with her out of pity. She has no other friends, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, she gets mixed in with the wrong people and she is always always ALWAYS dumping her problems onto me as if I am her therapist (funny enough she is an actual licensed therapist).

I feel as if I am obligated to stay friends with her. I don’t care for her and am tired of being that support system for her. I am tired of receiving her texts and constant requests to hang out. I am not interested in continuing to be her ‘friend’ but feel forced to continue out of pity. Don’t know what exactly to do here. Anyone who has been in this situation before please let me know what you did. ",0,1kxc7om,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxc7om/i_26f_have_realized_i_am_only_friends_with/
I (32M) think I fell out of love for my gf (27F) and I feel super bad… idk if I can get those feelings back.,"So my gf and I have been dating for a year and 4 months and lately I've been feeling kinda depressed, sad, and emotionless especially with my gf and I hate it. I want to be able to have those same feelings back again as I used to have and I've been trying. I take her out on dates, do activities together, go out to bars, get high, and stuff but just the feeling isn't coming back. We went out to this club on Saturday it was like emo night which had a lot of the music that we like (it wasn't really emo music, it was more punk, rock, metal, and some emo music) and she would always be holding me or holding my hand but for some reason I was getting annoyed? Like I just wanted to enjoy the music and dance without her holding me every 5 seconds.

I've been starting to realize that besides some same music taste, some same food tastes, drinking, smoking weed, we don't have a lot in common. I like to have deeper conversations and like to kinda analyze things and talk about them with my partner but when I try to do that, she just listens and doesn't provide a lot of input, I mean she does sometimes but a lot of the time she just ends the conversation. A lot of our conversations are surface level and only deep conversations we have are about her dreams. I feel like I'm not being challenged at all. Maybe it's the fact that we are in different stages of life? Idk because I have a career as a nurse and she's still a server at a restaurant so sometimes it's kinda hard to talk about things that happen at work you know?

I also work 6 days a week so when I'm not at work I'm with her so it does take a bit of a toll since I don't have a lot of time for myself. We like some of the same shows/movies but it's hard to find A LOT of shows/movies we both like so sometimes it does bother me and it feels like I'm not able to enjoy the things I like since I'm always with her if not at work and feel like I'm expected to do things with her only. We do go out to casinos (which sometimes I get annoyed cause she spends a lot on keno sometimes and wants me to play with her which I don't mind but she spends a lot and when I say I'm done and don't wanna take out anymore, she would take out money from her own account so I can play with her but I feel bad when she does it and always deny it but she gets upset so I end up feeling bad of her getting upset that I'm like fine and take it out my account or just sometimes be okay with her money), we go to bars (which also have keno so we always play when we go out to bars haha) and we go out to dinner or breakfast or we just stay in.

She does do a lot for me which I'm super grateful for. She likes to cook for me, surprise me with dessert, supports me, and is very loving which I love about her but I can't shake this emotionless feeling I've been having around her and it's really taking a toll on me. I'm feeling depressed. I do fantasize about being single as well which I don't like either. I hate this feeling and I feel like a POS for feeling this way. She's always saying she loves me, she misses me, and says a lot of sweet things to me but I'm just indifferent about it sometimes and say it back just to say it back. Idk if it's the fact that I need time for myself or this is me falling out of love. I honestly don't know if I can get those feelings I once had with her before. 

TL:DR: think I'm falling out of love for my gf and I hate it. Idk what to do if we should break up or try to get that spark again. We're just two different people in different stages of life and it is starting to eat me up. I'm often fantasizing about being single and idk if this is normal or a phase I'm going through.

My (18m) friend (18f) ghosted me and I’m not sure why,"I had a class with a girl and during this class we got each others snaps. When that semester ended we started messaging each other more  for several months, It was pretty much every day for months. we weren’t dating but we were at least friends. 

In one of our conversations we made a bet on something and she won, I asked her what she wanted and she said she wanted me to get her Tim’s(Canadian breakfast restaurant). I asked her when or where and then she stopped messaging me. After she didn’t respond to my messages I messaged her again asking if something was wrong and she said no and hasn’t talked to me since.

I’m not sure what to do, if I should just let the friendship go or if I should try and talk to her about it. I really don’t know why, getting Tim’s was her idea so I don’t think it’s that. I also don’t think that she was never interested in being friends because she would get “mad”(jokingly)if I left her on read and she would message me to talk without me messaging first.

"My boyfriend (28M) has gone away for work for 3 months, what are some healthy ways I (31F) can cope?","Hi everyone.

My boyfriend  (of just over 7 months) works for an American company (we are British) and has gone away for work. I totally support him and want him to have a lovely time, but I get extremely anxious about things due to past experiences.

Could anyone help give us some advice about healthy ways we can cope? And things I can do to support him?

Previous to this I was really anxious about him going so we didn’t really communicate about it. He’s done a ton to reassure me, bought me a build a bear with his voice in it and is FaceTiming we when he can. But having not particularly spoken to him before he went about it, I feel I’ve probably (stupidly) gone into it a bit cold turkey. 

I really love him and want our relationship to survive (as does he).

Time difference is 6 hours behind there.

We have suggested having week day morning calls (midnight for him, 6am for me) and evening calls (11pm for me, 5pm for him).

Can I please have an outsider’s perspective…?,"Okay so I’ve (19M) been talking with this friend (19F) for about 4 or 5 years now through instagram. The origin story is that I saw her regularly at a weekly social event, thought she was cool, but never really talked with her much. Months after moving away to Chicago, I reached out to her on a total whim. I didn’t have much confidence that she would answer, as we honestly didn’t know each other very much, but she did. 

Cut to today. We talk roughly once every three months, just making casual conversation. She has a lovely boyfriend. To be clear, we were never anything romantic, and what little romantic interest I had entertained before is long gone. There’s no honest way it would work out. But she’s still a blast to talk to, and I’m generally pretty isolated otherwise so I sort of cling to bygone people. 

The question that’s weighing on me is why the hell does she stick with me, too?

I feel like any other person in her position would have ghosted me by now. But she likes all my posts, has hearted many of my messages recently(and when I pointed it out she playfully pouted and teased me back), and often replies within the day. 

But the real tipping point, the catalyst behind this whole post here today, is this: I was looking for any kind of clue that she may have had a crush on me. We follow each other on Spotify, which I rarely even use, but I scanned through her playlists there… on a few separate lists, I noticed a wave of songs with bittersweet lyrics (conveying people drifting away, someone you find comfort in, unrequited feelings, frustration) that were added on dates that directly aligned with dates we had wrapped up a conversation on. Obviously it could be coincidental, and she’s in an amazing relationship elsewhere that I have no intention of spoiling, but I secretly sort of hope those songs are about me. 

Do you think that I should confront her about my suspicions? Should I be straight to the point or ease into it more naturally? I just plan on asking, “Why did you choose to stay with me after all this time? Is it because you’re lonely, clinging on to the past, or something else?”

TL;DR I think that a long-distance friend has had romantic feelings for me but never said anything about it. I feel like I have positive signals, but I want outside reassurance and am worried about being wrong. I don’t want to drift apart on a bitter note… I just want to make it clear between us.

I might be falling in love for the first time at 22.,"I (22NB) really do think I might be on the path to falling in love with someone (22NB) I started dating 2 months ago. 

For context, I have little to no experience with dating. I have never been in a relationship before this, only having my first kiss at 21 with someone (20M) who, (not so) deep down, I knew would end up hurting me. I now know that what I was experiencing was feeling wanted for the very first time, that maybe someone really COULD be interested in me. But I didn’t feel fireworks, and it didn’t feel like falling in love with him would be this inevitable thing. It felt awkward, forced almost. Any other experience I had before then was at most 7 or 8 different first dates organized via dreaded dating apps. All of these first date connections were ended by me. 

And then after my first and only situationship ended, I met them (22NB). The light of my life, someone that I never would have met if not for some completely unrelated, coincidental, shared glances.  

And wow. Fireworks. The best, most beautiful, wonderful fireworks I’ve ever seen. But also the scariest. It’s a slightly terrifying feeling, like my life will never be the same again; like my life will permanently be entwined with theirs, but in the best way possible. 

Though I think what makes it a bit scarier is that I am aware of my naïveté due to my lack of experience. But each and every time I step back and think further on it I’m met with the same overwhelming, ever so sure feeling that I am going to fall in love with them; that I want to be theirs, and them to be mine. 

Everything feels so secure, so right, so safe. It really is very easy to be there for them, to do better for them, to communicate with them. And it’s even easier to want to do all of those things. 

TL;DR: I have little to no experience with dating, and have never been in a relationship before this. But now I’m on the path to falling in love for the first time at 22, with someone I started dating 2 months ago.

I worked at a well-known company for about 15 months, but the pay was quite low, and I struggled to balance work with studying. I eventually quit to focus on exams full-time. I've cleared part of my exams and working towards finishing the rest. I do want to work again and be financially independent - just need time to get qualified. 
We recently spoke to our families about getting married. While mine is supportive, his parents - especially his father - are not very enthusiastic, mainly because I'm not currently employed. I heard he made a disrespectful comment about that. My partner stood up for me, but it still hurts. Feels like I'm being judged solely based on my job status. They not only expect me to be employed but to have a well-paying job before I'll be considered ""good enough"".

My partner  says he supports me regardless, but his family is pushing him to marry soon, and I'm not sure how long he can hold out. All of this is making me feel pressured and undervalued, and it's affecting my ability to focus on my exams. 

How do I talk to him about this without making things worse with his family? And how do I stay focused on my goal--  finishing my exams and building my career - without letting  this get to me?

TL;DR: In a long term LDR, my boyfriend's family is pressuring him to marry soon and judging me because I don't currently have a high paying job. I quit my low paying job to focus on a professional certification and want to be independent, but their comments are affecting my mental space and focus. My boyfriend supports me, but I'm unsure how to talk to him about his family without making things worse. Need advice on handling this pressure and stay focused on my goals.

My girlfriend’s best friend is ruining our relationship,"
For starters, we’re all 16 and last night after an argument with my girlfriend (of two months), let’s hypothetically name her Stacy, I realised her best friend (Megan, hypothetically) was a huge factor as to why it occurred. 

Pretty much, yesterday was a perfectly normal day, checked up on my girlfriend, Stacy, throughout the day because she was sick, sent her reels, etc. 

Then, in the evening, I decided to try this thing where I delete Instagram whenever I’m studying, but I kinda forgot to tell her and pretty much don’t respond to her messages for a couple hours or so, which doesn’t seem like a huge deal. Then on Snapchat, she texts me “where’d you go”, and I explain to her what I did and she doesn’t seem too happy about it (also she seemed to be in a bad mood for the back half of the day anyway). 

I was feeling sleepy, so I said goodnight and stuff but instead of the usual “goodnight” back, I get flamed for forgetting our two month anniversary THE PREVIOUS DAY. I try to explain to Stacy that I had a really rough and tiring day and pretty much got home and went to sleep, but before I finish explaining, she says “r u done with me or something”. I was genuinely so confused because in the moment, after the day seemingly went fine, this was quite literally out of fucking nowhere. 

I ask her why she thinks that, and she explains this is what happened (still not sure what actually was wrong at this stage), with her Megan’s relationship. Then she tells me that Megan told her to “end things with me before i do it first”. Like what the fuck. At this stage I was still fully clueless. I ask if it’s because I forgot the two month anniversary and she then says that Megan reads some of our texts and she thinks we “text like we hate each other”. Like who the fuck is she to determine if we like each other or not based off a few texts. So i’m trying to explain to Stacy, over text, that we should find a logical solution instead of going back and forth and she starts saying things like “mb for saying anything”, “im sorry for ruining your sleep for this”, but the context they were said in was very sarcastic and unapologetic. At this stage I just told her I’m sorry for anything i’ve done, said goodnight, and went to sleep.

Then, in the morning I wake up, see that I have 5 missed calls from her (i was on do not disturb), and A HUGE PARAGRAPH, which in summary said “i think we’re taking things too fast, we should take a step back and build a strong foundation, we should take the pressure off (there’s literally no pressure)”, and all of this was okay until i read “i think were not exactly in love right now but what we have is still really special we really like each other”. I thought these were all Stacy’s words at the time (they weren’t). 

So pretty much, I call Stacy, I explain my perspective, apologised for a bunch of minor things, and then ask “was Megan a factor in what happened last night”. She said yes. Then she apologised for everything, said she let Megan get in her head, and that she was in a bad mood and stuff. I expressed my concern over this and she confirmed she won’t let it happen again. Then she tells me that in the very long essay she sent me, Megan wrote half of it, mainly the parts where taking steps back and not loving each other were mentioned. This made me fume inside. 

Who the fuck does she think she is? Like her telling Stacy to break up with me before I do it first, WHEN I’VE LITERALLY DOME NOTHING WRONG IS SO WEIRD. Apparently at their school as well, Megan emphasises that us two are taking it too fast and stuff. She needs to shut the fuck up and mind her own business. Megan single-handedly created a huge argument between Stacy and I over quite literally fucking nothing. Stacy is all good with the pace of the relationship and she’s made it clear multiple times, and even today all of a sudden everything  magically seemed okay after the call we had in the morning.

My concern now is, what if Megan tries to pull this shit again. Idk if she’s jealous or what, but to me it’s currently a threat that hasn’t gone away. The outcome I am looking for is the best  way forward and what I should do next.

TL;DR Girlfriend’s bsf influenced her to start an argument with me out of literally nothing, told her to “breakup with him before he does it first” out of nowhere. It was completely baseless. The outcome I am looking for is the best  way forward and what I should do next.

Issues with my wife. Im at a loss and not sure what else to do.,"Having trouble with my wife.

My wife (f 28) and myself (30ftm) seem to literally have no intimate relationship. We've been together since 2020 and married since 2022 (5 years together 3 married) Yeah we hug and kiss and stuff. I love her very dearly. Last February she discovered some online profiles i had for dirty chatting with other people (I used that for maybe 3 months) At that point we hadn't been intimate for over 2 years. I gave her plenty of warning where I was with that before i got an email from one of my old profiles and re-activated it. We've since made a lot of head way. But damn if I still feel like my needs aren't being met. We still haven't had intimacy. Ive become more understanding of her feelings and I feel like I'm giving her what she needs in the relationship emotionally. Much of which I maybe didn't before. 

I carry my weight at home. I do all the cooking. I do the laundry. Walk and feed the dogs. I do the cat litter box. I build her nice things like garden boxes. I compliment her and snuggle. So it's not like I'm an additional responsibility she has to take care of. I just don't know what else to do here. I'm at a loss. I refuse to go another couple years without intimacy. It gives me some serious self esteem issues considering my body dysphoria to begin with and it's so hard for me to remain emotionally connected to someone im not physical with. 

Ill add that im autistic and she is unmedicated ADHD.

I feel like I'm doing everything I can but still get rejected whenever I even try. Any advice is appreciete.

TL;DR: been with my partner for 5 years and our bedroom life is dead. Help. What else can I try?",3,1kxb2ao,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxb2ao/issues_with_my_wife_im_at_a_loss_and_not_sure/
"My (22f) boyfriend (23m) violated my trust, can it be brought back?","I (22f) have (officially) been with my boyfriend (23m) for 2 months, but have truly been dating for over 5. The other night I had a gut feeling to go through his phone, which I’ve never done, and found multiple flirty texts to other women. I immediately confronted him about it and he’s been swearing up and down he’ll change, never do it again, and will do anything to regain my trust. I know it could just be words, but I truly love him and I really feel like he loves me- he treats me like an absolute queen and has never shown any major red flags like this. He admitted he did it out of insecurity and wanting compliments back, which stunned me because I call him handsome like ten times a day. He said he didn’t truly mean anything he said and that they mean nothing to him, he just wanted attention. Should I believe that? He feels like my best friend and boyfriend in one, I’ve never felt in love before him. I know I should probably leave him, but I think part of me truly thinks he could fix this. Should I leave him now and move on, or give a second chance?

"He (M24) lied to me (F24) for months, broke my trust, and now wants to fix things. But I don’t know how to feel safe again.","I’m struggling so much right now, and I don’t know who to talk to. I don’t feel ready to tell friends or family, so I’m hoping someone here might understand.

My boyfriend and I have been together for almost three years. We live together. A few weeks ago, I found signs he had downloaded things from porn websites. I asked him about it, and he insisted they were from before we met. He told me he hadn’t watched porn in years. This mattered to me, because of my own personal insecurities and history, which I’ve always been honest about.

I asked him multiple times, directly, emotionally, if he ever felt the need to do things alone, if he missed something. Every time, he said no. And that he only wants to do it with me, that I'm enough and the only one he's attracted to. But a few weeks ago, he admitted he had been watching porn and masturbating in secret for months.

It’s not just about the porn. It’s the lying and hiding when he knew it would hurt me. He watched me suffer, doubt myself, cry… and kept saying exactly what I wanted to hear. Now, he says he’s done with it, gave me access to his phone, and wants to rebuild. He says he didn't know how much it would hurt me, but he thinks he understands now how much it hurt me.

But I don’t know how to feel close to him anymore. I want to. I miss feeling connected. I still love him.  
But I keep replaying everything. I don’t feel safe, and I’m so tired of constantly questioning whether I’m enough. To make it even worse for me, he can climax to porn, but not with me. He says it’s stress or medication, but it hurts more than I can say.

How do you begin to trust someone again when you still love them, but they deeply hurt you? How do you feel close to someone when your whole body feels like it’s still flinching from betrayal? I don’t want to walk away, but I don’t want to lose myself either.

  
**TL;DR -** My boyfriend lied to me for months about secretly watching porn, even though he knew how much it would hurt me. He recently admitted it and wants to rebuild trust. I still love him and want to stay, but I feel heartbroken, anxious, and disconnected. How do I feel safe and close again after betrayal?",3,1kxaxmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kxaxmj/he_m24_lied_to_me_f24_for_months_broke_my_trust/
I (20M) have no idea if I should try to date this girl ( 19F ),"I ( 20M ) have been interacting with this girl ( 19 F  ) for a month now. I like her and tend to think about her a lot and I also do feel that she likes me back as well but still checking me out ( I say this cuz when I flirt she flirts back with me ). But through our interactions I sometimes doubt if I can have a healthy relationship with her because many a times I feel like I can't have long conversations with her which is also due to us having almost no common grounds to talk about. I do feel that this is normal but I also feel ( partly due to my older experiences ) that atleast when the relationship is in its early stages couples tend to try to spend time with each other every moment they can. But even If I feel like pursuing her might be a recipe for disaster but I can't stop being attracted to her. 
What I am asking here is how I should go ahead from here, what should I think of these feelings of doubt. And should I still try to date her, if yes how should I go about it for a healthy relationship ?

My girlfriend (20F) and my parents don’t get along, and now I (20M) feel stuck in the middle

Body:
I’ve been dating my girlfriend since high school — about 2 years now. We’re both 19 and currently sophomores in college. Things between us have been great, but there’s a serious issue with how she and my family (especially my parents and brother) get along — or rather, don’t get along.

The latest problem started on Easter. She came over to my parents’ house, brought a gift, dressed nicely, and made conversation during dinner. After she left, my parents told me they thought she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my older brother. They said she rolled her eyes every time he spoke and that she’s done this for years (though I honestly haven’t noticed that). They also said she came off as cold and dismissive toward them.

My girlfriend was shocked to hear that. From her perspective, she’s always tried to be polite, and she feels like my parents never really liked her and are constantly looking for reasons to dislike her. Because of that, she no longer feels comfortable coming over. She thinks anything she does will be twisted into something negative.

Now my parents are asking for an apology from her. It’s been about a month and she hasn’t apologized, because she doesn’t feel like she did anything wrong. Meanwhile, my parents say they’re losing what little respect they had for her, and it’s clear they don’t want her around until she “makes things right.”

So now I’m stuck. I love her and want this relationship to work, but I also want peace with my family. I hate this tension, and it’s hard feeling like I have to pick a side. I’ve tried talking to both sides, but neither is budging. I don’t even know what a “solution” looks like anymore.

If anyone’s been through something like this or has advice on how to move forward, I’d really appreciate it.

TL;DR:
My girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years, but she and my parents don’t get along. After Easter dinner, my parents said she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my brother. She says they’ve never liked her and now refuses to go over. My parents want an apology, she refuses, and I’m stuck in the middle trying to keep the peace. Not sure what to do.

Can’t stop overthinking,"So, the for the past few months I (35M) was in a relationship with someone (37F) who, due to a few different factors that I won’t go into, was in a very tough situation in life where she eventually told me she was unable to support a relationship. It took me a while to understand or accept this, and to be honest I still don’t know if I do. I fell for her fast after we started talking, and thought the course of my life was leading me to being with her forever. After she had told me she didn’t feel she could sustain a healthy relationship, communication dipped and I wasn’t able to see her for weeks at a time. When I did finally meet her for lunch one day a little over a month ago, she explained her situation to me, and how she didn’t foresee things getting better for her for at least a year once she was done with school. She had apparently understood that to be a breakup talk, and I wasn’t aware that’s what it was. I thought that if I held out a little longer, eventually we’d be able to reconnect and start spending more time together again. When we met next a few weeks later, something felt wrong. I can’t explain it, but my body was telling me something was wrong. Over the next few weeks she stopped sharing her location with me and hid her relationship status on Facebook.

This past weekend, I finally sent her a message explaining my need to move on with my life, that I couldn’t just sit in misery anymore, but my hope that we could reconnect when she was ready. I still love her, and sending that message was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. She understood and was sorry that I had been feeling the way I had been feeling.

What I discovered this weekend is that Instagram now has a feature where you can see what your friends like on reels. And the posts that’s she’s liked recently (I checked when they were posted) are all about having a new relationship and how “he” makes you feel and a whole lot of other suggestive stuff. Am I overreacting to be thinking that she has been seeing someone else already, despite telling me that she had no capacity to date anyone and that she viewed me as the only person she would ever want to be with?

My overthinking about this has kept me up for the past several nights. I haven’t been able to get a full nights sleep since I realized this was something I could see. If she didn’t want to be with me, I wish she would have just flat out told me that and not left me in this state. I don’t even know what I’m doing posting this here, just needed to vent to the void I guess.

tl;dr - How do I combat my overthinking about someone I love telling me they can’t support a relationship with me when I suspect they may have already moved on with someone else?",1,1kx8i8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kx8i8n/cant_stop_overthinking/
Feeling like I (29F) am outgrowing my partner (37M)… terrified and need advice,"***TW: Mentions of eating disorders***

*tl;dr: feeling like I'm outgrowing my partner of five years, who hasn't done anything wrong; needing advice or perspective!*

Hi everyone, I’m really struggling and could use some advice. I want to start by saying my partner (37M) is a kind, supportive, and wonderful person, and I (29F) love him like family. But I’m starting to question if that’s all there is to being in a relationship, and I’m terrified about it. I want to emphasise that he hasn’t done anything *wrong*, but something feels off, and I’m hoping for clarity.

We’ve been together for five years, but we met at work when I was 22. We got together at the start of the pandemic, and with strict COVID restrictions where I live, we got used to seeing each other just once a week, so the years kind of blurred together. 

During that time, I developed a severe eating disorder and became a shell of a human being, so the next two years from 2022 - 2024 felt like another blur. He was incredibly supportive through my recovery, and I’ll always be grateful for that, which is why I feel so incredibly guilty for how I’ve been feeling.

Here are the things that are nagging at me:

**1. Physical intimacy**: Somewhere around the 3 year mark, I stopped wanting physical contact. This coincided with my eating disorder (which can cause that) so I brushed it off. But even after full recovery, any sort of prolonged touch makes me uncomfortable. I started to wonder whether I might just be fully asexual, but going out and talking to people made me realize I *can* feel attraction…it’s just not happening with him. I want to stress that I have not met anyone else; it’s more that these interactions made me feel *interesting* again, something I haven’t felt in a while. I fully understand that this is normal in long-term relationships, but I can't help but wonder what it's like to be physically attracted to someone.

**2. Feeling disconnected**: He’s so kind and supportive, but every conversation either feels really shallow or one-sided. We have banter and it’s *fun,* but when we talk about anything serious I feel like I’m talking *at* him, not *with* him. This is also the reason why we don’t fight - he rarely contributes to the conversation. and when I repeat something later, it’s always like he’s hearing it for the first time, which makes me feel unheard. If I ask him to express his thoughts he will literally just tell me he has none, which brings me to the next point.

**3. How passive he is**: The biggest issue came when he quit his job after years of resenting it. I’m proud of him for choosing happiness, but he has never once spoken up about the unfair workloads. Not once. He just let the resentment build up and took it all in until he couldn’t anymore. This is a pattern: he will get upset but won’t voice his feelings or act, even after I’ve asked/encouraged/begged him to. It feels like he’s stuck in a cycle he won’t break, and I worry it’ll continue in a new job.

This is something that extends outside of work. Once, a stranger shoved me hard, and he did nothing. He didn’t say a word. And when I wanted to address it, he held me back. I understand wanting to avoid confrontation/trouble, but it really bothered me that he made it seem like a me problem.

Another time, someone took our paid seats at the theatre, and he suggested we just sit elsewhere. I handled it and got the seats back, but it was frustrating. I’m fully capable of standing up for myself, but I want a partner I know I can rely on to step up too, if that makes sense.

When I think about the future, I panic that I can’t count on him to make decisions or advocate for me, or us as a unit. This makes me feel so guilty because he’s technically done nothing “wrong,” and I love him like family. He’s still the same kind and thoughtful person, and seeing him feels like being at home. But I’m scared I’m outgrowing him, and I don’t know what to do.

Has anyone felt this way? How did you navigate it? I’d appreciate any advice or perspective. Thank you!",3,1kx7xrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kx7xrq/feeling_like_i_29f_am_outgrowing_my_partner_37m/
I (23m)am having trouble feeling love from my (23f) girlfriend,"I (23M) have been together with my girlfriend (23F) for a little over a year now. Like any other relationships we have our own ups and downs but overall it’s been great, at least for me. Ever since the start of 2025, I always had this feeling of she’s just using me for money or to do things for her. I don’t mind spending money on her or helping her with tasks but over the 1 year+ I don’t feel like she would have done the same.

Couple weeks ago I asked her a hypothetical question, “if I suddenly go broke/bankrupt would you still be with me?” Her answer seemed logical at first but I still felt a little hurt. She said “well if that happens I’ll probably stay for maybe 3 months to see if you’ll get more money again, if you don’t then I’ll probably leave”.

Another incident happened 2 weeks ago where she went out for dinner with this guy “A” and 2 other male friends. I don’t have anything against her seeing other old male friends as long as it isn’t 1 on 1. To provide more context, my girlfriend used to have a thing for “A” and she told me about it before. At first when she told me about this dinner I was uncomfortable and I told her about it. But she insisted on going and hesitantly invited me to go to “make me feel better”.

Fast forward to the day of the dinner, she only told me the general location of the restaurant and told me to wait for them. I had ot that day as work was really hectic so I arrived 10 mins late. I texted her when I arrived and asked her where should I meet them or which restaurant do I go into and waited. 30 minutes passed and still no response, I tried calling her and she never picked up. About 15 minutes later only she texted me the exact location of the place and told me to come to the restaurant.

I was already pissed for waiting so long after what seemed to be a chaotic day at the office. Right after we sat down, I noticed “A” wasn’t here yet but I didn’t ask any questions. 10 minutes had passed and her phone vibrated, I could see that it’s “A” texting her that he’s here. She darted to go out of the restaurant to bring him in. I was very deeply hurt. In my head it was just this thought that “wow she is okay with letting me wait for almost an hour but she sprinted out to get “A”?”

Not only that, throughout our relationship she has never once suggested activities or even showed the need/want to hangout. It was always me planning a trip, planning a date or even going out for food. Overtime I was getting more and more anxious and jealous and insecure of myself to the point where I would want to know where is she and who is she with.

We have this app called “life360” which tracks each other’s phones and we can know each other’s location in case of emergencies. We always get notifications when we leave our house and I always update her beforehand where I’m going and who’s going to be there so that she doesn’t feel worried or anxious. But she rarely updates me and barely texts me about who she’s seeing or where she’s going.

I’ve talked about this with her before and she always dismisses it by saying “why’re you like this? You were never like this before?” Or empty promises to update me more often. I’m not sure what to do or what to feel anymore. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.

My (24f) bf (24m) mom (54f) is making rude comments about my family,"We’ve been dating for over a year and a half now and I’ve noticed that my boyfriend’s mom has started with her comments about my family. For context there was situations in the beginning of the relationship where she told me she wanted me to get pregnant 5 months into our relationship so she could have a grandchild already. I told my boyfriend this made me uncomfortable and her told her to stop and the next time we were alone she told me “you don’t have to tell your boyfriends everything you know.” And after this I just kept my guard up. She would also talk down about him and say he was too needy and that his older brother (30m) was so smart and my bf was just eh. 



Things calmed down until I started inviting her to hangout with my aunts mom and I. She told my aunt c (55f) to find herself a married man and have an affair with him.. she then proceeded to tell the same aunt “it’s people like you that I don’t go to church anymore”. This took my aunts and mom aback because my aunt wasn’t saying anything bad about her religion. She was just converting to a new religion and that set my bf’s mom off. She then told my second aunt d (54f) that aunt c gained weight. Mind you they have only met 3 times. Aunt d was taken aback again and said that was peculiar to think. 

Then she complains to my mom that my bf calls my mom “mom” but I don’t call her “mom” and why is that? My mom then had to tell her that maybe she just doesn’t feel like it right now and is waiting if they ever get married. She was visibly upset about it because she brought it up again 2 other times. Then my bday happened and we ordered catering from BJ’s and she told my mom “your food is so good you’re a great cook” and it kind weirded my mom out because she kept telling my mom that even though my mom didn’t cook this day. She then mentioned it to me the next day again so weird. All of these comments are just adding up and up and I don’t know what to do because my bf is the sweetest guy there is and I don’t want to ruin anything.

She then came home with a dog for my bf and ever since then she’s been trying to tell me where to take the dog to get shots what medicine to give him and such and not telling my bf.. ngl I didn’t ever consent to wanting a dog too..  

I do feel though that if we get married it’s going to get worse and that’s what’s scaring me of commitment, I don’t know what to do..

**TL;DR;** my bf’s mom is making rude comments about my family calling my aunt fat basically, hinting my mom doesn’t know how to cook, telling me to get pregnant so she can have a grandkid already 5 months into our relationship, bought him a dog and is also telling me I’m responsible for him too. I feel like it’s scaring me away from him since we plan to get married and I don’t know if I should confront him?

"I'm starting to think I'm crazy, need honest input about possible cheating","I'm a 40 (f) and my partner 38 (f).

Here's the situation:

My partner and I together for over 5 years. When we met she told me about an online friendship we had with a man she was interested in. They met online and started talking. He's a ""public figure"" of sorts and asked her to meet up and go for a walk. She never met up with him, but I could tell by the way she told the story that she was very impressed with him and somewhat shocked he wanted to meet up.

Fast forward, I know she still has a friendship with this person. She mentions him once in a blue moon (a project he's working on or something like that.) One time, she mentions that he would like to meet me. I find this a bit strange, because I've never had a conversation with him or any connection. I know that while they've had this online relationship, they've never met in person.

Fast forward a few months ago, she flies to LA for a work event. I pick her up from the airport and notice she is DMing someone. I notice she's DMing for quite a while. I only read on the screen ""did you get home?"" And I see the name. This person is this man's ex partner. They still coparent and live together (strange I know). I get a very weird feeling in my gut. I'm thinking to myself, did she meet this person and his coparent? I can't get it off my mind, so the next day I ask ""did you see (persons name) when you were in LA?"" Immediately she answers ""yes."" I ask her where and she says she went to their house and played with their kid. I ask her why she didn't tell me. I am at this point feeling very confused and upset. My ex has social anxiety and drove over 40 minutes to these people's house. It's unlike her.

I start asking her questions, specifically why she wasn't honest about going there. She gets highly defensive. She starts yelling and telling me I'm crazy. Her reaction makes my stomach sink. I tell her something is going on here, and I have never had a feeling like this before. Specifically with this man. The next day, he DM's me and basically tells me that nothing at all happened, and that he doesn't appreciate me making an assumption. I found out my ex told him private parts of our conversation. I feel completely betrayed. And I'm made to look crazy.

A few months ago, I'm going through financial records. I recognize a bunch of charges from 2023-present to this one company. I come to find out this is this man's company. He hosts webinars and you only need to pay a donation fee. I don't want to share the exact amount, but it comes to my attention that my ex has spent over $5,000 going to these webinars and I was not aware. She never told me this. Each charge is around $500 with a few for $1000. Now I'm really feeling betrayed. Especially because our shared funds were paying for his events, and he was outright accusatory towards me. She never once told me she was attending these events, let alone making such large donations. She had filed them with our bookkeeper as ""charity.""

This makes me go through her phone records and I see that she is still having a few phone calls with him. Even after I'm upset about her going to his house. I was under the impression that after she violated my boundaries and shared personal information with him, that she didn't speak with him anymore. But she did, after he was rude towards me.

Advice is much needed and appreciated

TLDR: Partner was caught going to a home of someone she was interested in the past. I know his coparent was there, but it still felt weird because she lied about it. She then told him I suspected something was going on and he (somewhat) told me off on DM. I also came to find out she spent $5,000 over a year and a half on his webinars that she never mentioned to me.",2,1kx5rcm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kx5rcm/im_starting_to_think_im_crazy_need_honest_input/
"On and off relationship for 8 years. Don't know what to do next, advice?","I [22F] and my [M25] boyfriend have been together officially for 7 years. We took a break last year, I broke up with him because I felt as though my needs weren't being met and I felt neglected and like I wasn't important to him. 

We've been seeing each other regularly for the last year but he doesn't want to put a label on anything yet. He's currently in school and his family basically hates me for leaving him for someone else. 

For some background information to better understand, his family is very emotionally unavailable and I came from a very emotional family and have learned its best to talk things out and express emotions and feelings instead of sweeping them under the rug. 

His mother would make fun of me for not knowing basic things in front of their family members and make fun of personal problems I have with sensory things and he would never say anything in my defense after expressing that it hurt my feelings.They would bash my family and judge me if I ever came to them for guidance as I do not stay in contact with my own family anymore and don't have many friends thinking I could come to her as she'd call me the daughter she never had.

Over the years I felt like I did most of the sacrificing in our relationship, driving every weekend to see him after he refused to leave his apartment with his roommates to spend the weekend at my apartment where I lived alone because he didn't have his PC with him or he didn't have his rig. 

We spent a limited amount of time together alone without videogames or getting high, mainly when we'd run errands or be waiting for his friends to get home, from work, or watching tiktoks. When his friends got home I'd basically be sitting around bored for hours and sometimes crying because I felt left out and unwanted. His friend is very disrespectful to women and would subject him to grossly inappropriate content and games where he'd be playing as an unrealistic nude girl with unlimited customization options. 

When we would be intimate together, he'd always ask me to dress up and basically be something that I'm not, it got to the point where he'd be watching porn while we were doing things and there was a few times that I would cry or break down during it and it was just awful and extremely unhealthy for my already existing insecurities from being body shamed my whole life by my family, I weigh 230lbs and have a nice figure for my weight and height. 

I was very verbal through the entirety of our relationship with how he made me feel, making me be something I'm not, never complimenting me after basically asking in every way possible, never emotionally being there for me when I was going through personal and family problems. Sometimes I feel like we're incompatible but I love him very deeply and part of me feels that way because he was my first intimate partner but Im in love with him.

Over they years I discovered his porn addiction and him micro cheating in private chat rooms. I've also found a post on hook up pages on Reddit which he swore he never followed through with physically but did meet up with a girl and smoked weed together and watched tv apparently. His social media algorithms are so personalized that even on Facebook he can't scroll for like two minutes without seeing boobs or something inappropriate. On tiktok is ads for sexy outfits, girls thrist trapping like every 10 to 15 videos. He's now asking about me wearing more specific things which im not entirely comfortable with.. I love him so I want to make him happy but I'm also afraid that I'm disrespecting myself and if I say no he'll find it somewhere else or resort back to chat rooms if he ever stopped that to begin with.. we're not even officially together but we're exclusive according to him, even though he won't tell anyone about us and we aren't living together.. 

I've talked to my friends about this many many times over the years and they all say the same thing, that it's not a good match, he isn't treating me the way a boyfriend should, that I deserve better. In my heart I think I  know that but I don't know what I'd do without him. He understands me so well but at the same time not in the ways I need him to understand me. We've talked about doing relationship counseling but even if we do, I'm scared his family will still hate me and be unkind to me and I'm worried that I'll still feel this way. 

Tl;dr - what to do? Am I in the wrong, should I be more understanding and supportive? Am I allowing myself to be mistreated? Advice ",3,1kx5f7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kx5f7k/on_and_off_relationship_for_8_years_dont_know/
23f going for a short trip leaving 24m for the first time in over a year,"TL;DR:
My boyfriend and I (23F, 24M) have been together for over 3.5 years—starting with a long-distance relationship and now living together in Australia for 1.5 years. We haven’t spent a single day apart in that time, and we’ve built a safe, loving life together. I want to visit my family and friends in India for 3 weeks, but he can’t come due to work and finances. While he understands why I need to go, he’s emotionally struggling with the idea of being alone at home. I feel really guilty and heavy about leaving him, even though we plan to stay connected. I’m looking for advice on how to better handle these emotions and this situation.

------------

Hi! I'm a 23F and my bf is 24M. We have been together for over 3.5 years. We are living together for over a year a half now in AU. Before moving countries and living together, we were in an LDR for over two years, having met only once in that period. We live internationally while our families are based in India. We both are working, he works in office and I WFH - which kinda gives me a lot of flexibility.

I haven't visited my family (parents and brother) and my friends back home in all this time. He hasn't either, and for even longer - about 3 years now. Me and him have not spent a single day apart in this period. It has brought us close in a different way that makes me bawl my eyes out of adoration for this man. We are content and we have built a lifestyle here, which makes me feel very safe.

Although I have stayed connected to my family and friends regularly, I really wanted to go on a short three week break back home to meet everyone. My partner cannot make it with me because of his work and financial commitments - he really does want to but that would a callous decision considering his responsibilities. We are both upset about me leaving for a short time, but he is a bit more affected by this change because he would be alone at home, in a space that he's always shared with me. He said he understands why I need to go but there's this beautiful and vulnerable side to him which is asking me to stay back.

For some reason, I'm feeling guilt and this heaviness thinking about leaving. I reassured him that we will stay connected like we did when we were in LDR - but I still want to know how to handle this better.

Can anyone give me a perspective? Or any advice that might help me better navigate through this situation?

Not sure how I (26F)  feel about bf (24m) sending a voicememo to his female friend,"
So I’m (26F) in a relationship with this guy (24M) for about 1,5 years. Let’s say the beginning was perfect and then he emotionally cheated one month in but we got over it and small minor things happened but he also tried his best to regain my trust.

TLDR: boyfriend sent a voicemessage to a female friend asking if she got a boo, a shawty or a dude that can call her that… read the last paragraph for more info.

Fast forward to now: since March we have had many fights to the point of breaking up here and there. But we would be back within days.  He would cry, I would cry (much more) and all would be well. It’s very toxic but I love him very much and I do think he loves me too but now I’m questioning it. The last few weeks we had some pretty big arguments where he would say hurtful things like: “I don’t want you” and more like this. I’ve became insecure again and would check his social media (I would never check his chats just is he followed someone new or if he’d be looking up girls. Please don’t come after me, he broke my trust a few times and he gave me this willingly to reassure me and it did help so I haven’t checked in a long time until today). 

So today we called and he really wanted to play a game with me for days but I had some problems installing this game so it took a few days before we got to it. Today was the day but unfortunately his wifi didn’t work and he got pissed and said he would go sleep. I asked him if we couldn’t spend a bit more time on call instead because we haven’t played the game at all due to his connectivity issues and we only called briefly. I already feel a bit insecure lately due to his statements and the arguments and whereas before he would love to call every day, lately through the fights we didn’t call as much anymore. So when I asked he blatantly told me no to which I replied that I understand he is upset he couldn’t play the game due to his wifi as he was looking forward for days to playing this game with me, why would he not want to spend time with me playing a different game because we haven’t called that much (and we had a big argument only two weeks ago lasting more than a week where we didn’t call so I missed him). He literally hung me up midsentence. He had done this before and I find this very disrespectful. I tried calling him many times as this got me upset because he could just wish me goodnight and not try to push his frustrations with his wifi unto me? It’s like he just wanted to play that game but not really spend time with me for that matter. He seemed almost annoyed with calling while earlier this day he called me very happy and was just his old self (yesterday we had another small argument..).  He literally scolded me, said some words, was very hard towards me.. while I only asked why he hung me up like that.

He went to sleep and I went on his Instagram. I saw he texted one of his girl friends that he wants to see her again at their friends house (she was an old coworker and it was never romantically or anything like it and I believe that he told me she was a lesbian). But also said: muchos love ❤️
And this annoyed me because I know he would be upset if I would say the same to an old coworker friend. Anyhow it was more upsetting to me that he would treat me this evening like an annoyance but then ask an old coworker to hang out again..

But alas, the reason of my post is the following: I saw an earlier message thread between him and an old classmate. His last voicememo, dated 15 March 2024, literally said the following: “do you have a boo (-name of the girl-)or a shawty, or a dude that can call you a shawty, or are you to HC for it” something along these lines. He said it so flirty too. Am I going crazy? This was a month after the emotional cheating occurred and three months into the relationship…  I sent him many angry texts at this hour but he’s still asleep so I have no clue what the next steps are. Do I just block him? Is this platonic? Would a guy in a relationship send this to a female friend? She never even responded to it.

idk what to do about my bf,"
i (20f) and my boyfriend (20m) have been together for quite some time. I don’t know if I’m being overly emotional right now. But today I had a really bad day and before the situation that caused the bad day happened, I messaged my boyfriend in the morning and asked him if he wanted to watch a movie I saw on TikTok. He said yeah we can. We normally call every night and sometimes we watch movies because we don’t live together. and I waited the whole day for him to be free so we can finally watch the movie. I’ve been wanting to watch for a couple days now. It was getting late. And he had work tomorrow. So I asked him how long is he going to be so that we can start watching. He then said that he’s going outside, this was around 11pm and he came home at 1 am. And this movie is about two hours long, so I was a bit mad because I knew he would’ve ended up falling asleep halfway into the movie. And I was waiting all day to watch this movie. I then told him that I’m mad because he came late. And that he would’ve fell asleep during the movie. I also told him that I waited the whole day for him. He just kind of brushed it and said okay we can watch something else at episode of something. And I told him that no I wanted to watch this movie specifically and I waited the whole day. He then said for me to just watch it on my own and he doesn’t understand that I’m upset. 


Is he disregarding my feelings? I feel like he doesn’t care about how he makes me feel. 
And I’m stuck between sticking through the disrespect because I love him and we have a lot history together or leaving because of the disrespect. I just feel like he doesn’t love me as much as he did because he would have never responded the way he did. Am I being over emotional? little stuff like this always happens but i feel like this is the last straw. 



TLDR- i just don’t think he respects me enough anymore or cares about my feelings. is it a phase bc i don’t have it in me to carry on like this. ",2,1kx3tbj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kx3tbj/idk_what_to_do_about_my_bf/
"My (38F) husband (46M) gets defensive during hard conversations and says mean things but then immediately backtracks, and I am confused. What words I should believe?","For years any time I've tried to have a constructive conversation about issues in our relationship my husband gets defensive. I've used gentle openings, ""I"" statements, adjusted my tone, and a bunch of other ideas from therapists, all without help. Every time he gets defensive, shuts down, and it turns into an argument. I've reached my limit on the relationship. He finally agreed to try therapy but he's only had one session. He says he doesn't know why he gets defensive but he's working on it. But him working on it seems more confusing. So for example if I bring up a concern, his immediate reaction is to turn it around and blame me or say really mean hurtful things to me about that concern. Its like he just verbally attacks me. But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words. But I wonder why mean hurtful things are the first thing he says and is that a reflection of what he is really thinking and then the backtracking is censoring himself? Thoughts?

We met through a friend and have always found our way back to each other through multiple friend groups and different settings. We used to consider each other to be brother and sister at one point, given how close we were. When we were 16, we started a romantic relationship with each other. We have been dating for the past 2 years now, things are great and we love each other lots. 

We were reminiscing on the past earlier and we brought up how we were basically siblings before we started dating. It was brought up how we sort of missed those times because there was a sort of tension between us. It got me thinking, were we better off to be friends rather than being partners, yes things are great between us but it got us thinking loads. I'm thinking it was maybe because it was something new and we were just kids so it felt fresh and more fun.

I [20M] and my old time Friend [20F] start to ghost me. how I behave?,"I start saing that i am sorry English is not my first languege. I've been close friends with this girl for 3 years. I usually see her about once a month or a bit more often, at the beach, and we had a great friendly relationship — we were genuinely open and honest with each other.

About 4 months ago, we had a light argument about some ideas. Nothing serious, no insults or anything, just some teasing remarks — the kind I often make with other friends, really nothing major.

After that, we continued talking like usual for about 10 more days — sharing music links or memes on Instagram, and sometimes just asking how we were doing. Then, suddenly, she just ghosted me.

I only realized it about a month later when she stopped replying to my messages (yeah, I know, I’m not exactly quick on the uptake). So I understood something was wrong, and I sent her an apology message — but she never replied.

Some more time went by, and I noticed she had hidden her Instagram stories from me on both her accounts, without actually blocking me.

I was really down about it, so I sent her a long message explaining how I was feeling — again, no response.

The last thing I did was comment under a concert post she made, asking if it was a specific stage — and she replied just with a “yes.” That’s it. Her stories are still hidden from me, and she’s not replying to any of my messages.

I’ve always had great relationships with my friends, and I’ve always had plenty of them. I honestly don’t know how to act now.

My friends, who know every detail of the story, tell me I should just leave her alone — that she was rude and disrespectful.

But I’d like a second opinion from strangers, and also try to understand possible reasons for her behavior. I’ll see her again in August at the beach because we have mutual friends, and I don’t know whether I should talk

My BF/27 wants his autistic brother to live with us when his parents can no longer do so and it scares me,"TLDR: My BF/27 wants his autistic brother to live with us when his parents can no longer care for him. I’m scared because I don’t think I can

I 26/F have been with my 27/boyfriend for over 7 years now. And we’ve been starting to talk about leveling up our relationship to the next level. He’s a good man and I do love him but I’m really scared about the future.

For context, he has a 20yo sibling who has severe autism. He has a brain of a 2-year old. Cannot communicate (but somewhat understands a few words based on his reactions), and does vocal stimming. Right now he’s under the care of both of his parents.

My bf told me that when the time comes that his parents can no longer take care of his brother, he plans to take him in with us. And that just scared me. I’m a light sleeper, so if he does vocal stimming at night (at worst, every night) idk if i’m ever going to get enough sleep. He seems kinda violent sometimes (at one point, he pulled my hair really hard at their family gathering for no reason). And I also want to have a dog in the future but I’m not sure if he’s going to be okay with it? (Right now they have dogs but they don’t let them inside the house). And what about if we have kids… how are they going to react. To add, he also poops everywhere and literally needs to be monitored 24/7 because he does a lot of things like drinking water from the toilet, or eating things he shouldn’t. As a person who loves to travel, I feel like when he starts living with us, we won’t be able to travel as a complete family as he would have to stay with him.


There’s all sorts of questions in my head and anxious thoughts that weigh so much. I don’t want to breakup and sometimes I blame myself for not thinking through this from the very beginning. But I don’t regret every single moment with my bf. I love him so much and I was ready to be his bride… not until this thought came into the picture.

My (21F) boyfriend's (23M) grandmother recently passed away and I don't know how best to support him,"Hi all, my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together almost 5 years now. We met in university and have been graduated for about a year or so, at which points we both moved back to our hometowns. He lives with his parents, little brother (9M), and grandmother which is quite normal here for young adults (I also live with my parents). Due to the job market where we live, it's been difficult for him to find a job but he's been filling his time split between helping out with his dad's shop and taking care of his little brother.

Very recently, his grandmother suddenly passed while his parents were away on a rare vacation. Because his dad was away, he was fully in charge of the store for the first time and had been there early morning until evening the past week - which is where he was when he recieved the call about his grandmother. Thankfully, someone was at the house who was able to help bring his grandmother to the nearest hospital but unfortunately, she had already passed when he got back. It was honestly a very heartbreaking and stressful day, and I had came when I heard the news from him. I grew up quite sheltered and perhaps, as a consequence, came out a bit ignorant when it came to real-world things such as this, as I've never so closely witnessed a relative's passing until now. Therefore, I had already advised him to contact our other close friends who I knew had experiences (unfortunately) with loved ones' passings, to maybe better help him work through the following legalwork, procedures, etc. while also lending a shoulder to cry on. I stayed the entire day with them all because I just wanted to support him in whatever way I could, even if I maybe didn't know how. To add, this was honestly a life-changing experience for him because not only did he experience a family member's passing, I think it was the first time he truly felt and was forced to be a 'functioning adult' in the family. For all intensive purposes, he was the sole head of his family during this ordeal. 

He's been up and down emotionally and I'm trying my best to just be there for him, but sometimes I feel that he doesn't want to be seen as vulnerable in front of me. To add on, when he does get suddenly emotional, I also just never seem to be there which frustrates me so bad because it breaks my heart knowing how broken he must feel and all I really want to do is support him but I just don't know *how*. I do try to reassure him and I told him as well how proud I was seeing him take charge of the situation so effectively, checking on him personally, especially now that his family's here (long history), but he gives me nonchalant answers like ""I'm alright"" or ""Yeah, thanks for being here"". I don't want to force him to share with me, so I don't try to pry further but it's the same answer in the same neutral tone every time even when I know he's just cried some time before (his friends would tell me). I also know grief is incredibly complex and therefore, might not be a continous wave of emotions, so that also deters me from prodding further because maybe he does feel alright in the moments I ask and my asking would just be triggering something unnecesary.

His friend group, who he's had since high-school, has been a tremendous help and have been there consistently for him as well which I'm grateful for since I think they help him take his mind off things. They're quite rambunctious, but in a funny way and the dynamic between them all is a lot of jokes (which is great since it helps put a smile on his face despite everything he's faced and is facing). So, I'm really glad honestly to see him with them because at least he regains emotions even if I'm not the one making him laugh. 

But, to be frank, I've really just felt helpless throughout this entire thing and I think it's starting to show. He's really good at reading me, especially when something's not right, so he's already starting to catch on that something's wrong with me. He's been asking me if everything's alright and that he's sorry for being so busy with everything, or that he's sorry if he's done something and I, of course, always tell him that there's nothing to be sorry for and to stop worrying about me, because the real problem is me. I don't feel like I've contributed anything at all where everyone else has helped in the funeral logistics, procedural advice, or just helping him take his mind off things for a moment, and it just makes me feel useless because it breaks my heart knowing the hurt and stress he's feeling and I feel helpless in supporting him. I love him so much and we have plans for a future together, but how will that look if I can't even help him now?

I know this is a selfish perspective because none of this is about me but I just can't shake this overwhelming guilt. I don't want to burden him more with any of this but if I can't control it, he will for-sure confirm that something's up and it might inadvertently add to his pressures as well. Originally, I planned to just keep it all to myself but now I'm wondering if it's better to say something sooner rather than later so we can work through this quickly and get back to the real focus of the situation. At the same time, I also hate this idea because morally, I think it's wrong and again, *it's not about me*, so I should just bottle it all up and mask myself better. I don't know, maybe I'm still a little naive and young in terms of serious relationships because I can't think of any other solutions. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what to do here and moving forward because even after crying out my frustrations alone, I still feel the guilt and helplessness and it's impeding on my being there for him, which is what I really want to do. 

Sorry that it came out so long and massive apologies if a lot of it sounded like one, big whine. I just thought it relevant to show why and how I've been feeling helpless alongside some other contexts. I'm also not a big poster so sorry if some things are not right!

TL;DR My long-time boyfriend's grandmother passed away very recently and I've felt useless in being there for him as I'm not sure how to. Meanwhile, his friends and family have been a tremendous help and it makes me feel even more guilt. He's starting to catch on that something's wrong with me and now, I'm not sure if I should voice something to avoid further burden on him so that we can quickly go back to what's truly important or if this is a me problem and I should just fake it better until I resolve it myself. Is this all just a self-centred train of thought? And how can I just get back to supporting him without any worry because that's all that I really want to do.

I (F23) had a breakdown and now I’m scared I’m ruining my relationship with my boyfriend,"Hi Reddit. I don’t really post, but I need to vent and maybe get some advice because I feel completely lost right now.

I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost two years. We’ve talked about moving in together soon, and while I’m excited, I’m also nervous. I have anxiety, and it really affects how I process emotions and interact with the world. I overthink *everything*. I also tend to cry a lot when I’m overwhelmed, which makes it hard to communicate clearly and it makes me feel ashamed.

Over the long weekend, I went to visit my boyfriend. He lives one town over. He was playing video games, and I didn’t want to just stare at my iPad after working 40 hours that week, so I went to the living room to watch a new reality show instead. About 30 minutes later, he came out and (in what felt like an aggressive tone) said:  
“Can you stop having an attitude?”

That completely threw me off. I didn’t even realize anything was wrong. When I tried to ask what he meant, I got overwhelmed and started crying as I genuinely didn’t know what I had done. He apologized, but I still felt hurt and confused.

Then, as all this was going on, his parents walked in (they had just come in from out of town), and I had to immediately act like nothing was wrong. Internally, I was falling apart. I ended up crying nonstop sunday and monday.

I eventually left early and went back to my apartment. When I got home, I called him and tried to explain what I was feeling. I said something like: “Hey, I’ve been sitting with a lot from this weekend. I know you’re stressed with work stuff, and I really do get that. I just ended up feeling really shut out, and when things got tense, I didn’t feel emotionally okay staying. I also know I shut down around your parents  I just felt exhausted and didn’t know how to talk about it.""

His immediate response was: “I think you need to go back to therapy.”

That hurt. I know he’s stressed, but I felt dismissed. It made me question everything. Since then, we’ve been distant. I love him a lot, but now I’m wondering… is it over? Did I mess this all up?

TLDR: I (23F) visited my boyfriend (26M) over the weekend. He got upset and told me to “stop having an attitude” when I was just watching TV alone. I got overwhelmed, started crying, and felt really dismissed. His parents walked in mid-breakdown, and I had to pretend I was fine. I left early and tried to calmly explain my feelings later, but he just told me I “need to go back to therapy.” Now we’re distant, and I feel confused, ashamed, and wondering if this relationship is right or if I messed it all up.

My GF (35F) and I (39M) have very different social personalities and I do not know if I can cater to her introversion and insecurity forever.,"I (39M) have been with my GF (35F) for about 5 years. I love her. The idea of breaking her heart kills me. We live together, have animals together, and have discussed buying a house. She pushes more and more for a ring. The issue is, every time these ""forever"" events get discussed, my mind goes to all the things she does that drive me insane or make me insecure about the relationship.

For instance, I am very extroverted. I need to be social and hang out with friends or I get very withdrawn and short with people. However, she does not want to go out and do those things regularly. She needs a week to get enough social energy for a few hours out. The issue comes when I make commitments to things that do not involve her that take me out of the house (social organizations, etc.) then all I hear is how much she misses me and wishes I was home. I cannot be home as much as she wants me to be and support my mental health but if I am not home, I hear about how she and the dogs miss me and she will be glad when I am done with this activity so I am home again.

I NEED this social stimulation and I understand that she NEEDS to not feel pressured to be social. She has suggested on occasion joining me at some of my events but she wants to get there at the start time and leave either before or as soon as things wrap up because her battery is spent. That cuts into the social aspect for me because its the socialization before and after that really make the events enjoyable.

I cannot imagine starting over again without her, but I also cannot picture a future where I am stuck at home for fear of being nagged about going out again.

"I (55F) have trust issues, and my BF (44M) is pushing them. Or is he really just seeking validiation, and can I provide that?","I'm in a great relationship except I think my BF is looking for validation from other women. Should I try to work through it with him?

I've been in a great relationship for 3 months--really really good. But I've caught my BF chatting with other women. The first time, with a high school friend who he swears is just an old friend and needed relationship advice. He showed me a couple of innocuous texts. Then I noticed he had sent her a picture of himself. Which upset me, so I asked to read the rest of the messages. He said no and got super defensive and immediately deleted the app and messages. He said he had shared things about his mental health that he didn't want me to read, and that's all. He knows I have severe trust issues because my last BF was a serial cheater, so after lots of back and forth, he said he'd ask her to send him screenshots of their conversation. Which was more than 2 weeks ago.

He's been guarding his phone ever since, which makes me even more suspicious. I asked to look at it, since he told me early on that I could, but now he has changed his mind. He says it is a boundary issue and not that he has anything to hide. However, yesterday, after I asked him again about the screenshots and he said he was still working on it (again), he relented and let me look at some of his pictures. When I opened his photos I saw screenshots of of texts he had with his ex-gf--he immediately grabbed the phone and deleted them even though they were fairly innocuous. But what freaked me out was when I opened his Reddit app and saw that he had begun chatting with a woman. Nothing romantic had been exchanged. He said he was lonely and looking for friends. I asked to read more and he immediately deleted his account.

He continues to swear that there isn't anything to see or hide, and he even tried to recover the Reddit account. So maybe he just needs to feel some validation? I really don't think he has done anything in person, but I know he isn't being completely honest with me either. He swears I am the only woman and regrets responding to the woman's introduction on Reddit. He acknowledges that he caused this and wants to fix it, if I'll give him another chance.

Please help Us! Ready give up,"
30M and my girlfriend 30F, together 8 years, we are hoping to have a kid together sooner than later. However, I have serious reservations which is putting me off the idea. 

Her Dad is obbessed with conspiracy theories, Anti Medicine, screams, shouts and swears when confronted. He never calls her unless she calls him; he never visits her, only her visiting him even though he lives doors away. He has threatened every member of family. He does not take responsibility for anything that has happened in his life and goes crazy if challenged on any of his views. Blaming his aggression as out of his control, followed by a sob story and crying.

Her Mum treats her like a child, she is very immature and loves family drama and gossip. 

Her mum and dad are not together but still obsessively stay in touch. They point score and can often be insufferable, the roles are reversed. Dad living with sister due to dad not being able manage his finances as wastes all money on Cigerettes and Cannabis. Mum is every emotional and demands children's attention. 

My GF is submissive to them both, can never challenge their views, so let's dad fall deeper in to his views and his behaviour is widely accepted within the family. Same cycle of dad being abusive, apologies, crys they all hug him.

I cannot bring a child in to this environment. I need her to prove to me that she can stand up to them and do what's best for her and our future child. Right now I don't believe she can. 

Is this too much for to ask of her? 

Any tips on what she can do? 

She is planning a 30th girls night out, even this she felt compelled to invite her dad to avoid upsetting him. Whenever I try to talk to her about standing up she runs away in to another room

Another example of something really wrong is that last year her nan passed away, her dad during his daughters grieving keeps saying she was murdered by the NHS and trying show weird autopsy videos. When she asked him stop he kicked off.

M18 F18 Girlfriend gets defensive and invalidates me when I bring up issues,"For context, we are both 18 and have been dating for almost 2 years. 

Whenever I try to bring up an issue I have with our relationship, my girlfriend gets defensive and questions why I have an issue with something rather than validating my feelings.

For example, we were hanging out with some friends, and she was talking with some of her friends and making jokes about getting each other pregnant, and eventually they began to joke about cheating on me. I knew it was just a joke, but it made me incomfortable anyways. 

I decided to bring this up to my girlfriend by saying the jokes they were saying hurt and made me uncomfortable. She went on to say that she thought it was obvious that it was just a joke, and she didn't understand why it was such a big deal. She also said that she wishes she didn't have to worry about what she says all the time because of how I feel.

My issue is not necessarily the jokes, it's the fact that she chooses to defend why something she does is okay even if I have a problem with it.

If she told me that I was doing something that was bothering her, I would stop it because I prioritize her feelings and I'm willing to make sacrifices like that for her. 

I do NOT want to break up with her. There are too many beautiful parts of our relationship that are worth this struggle. If anyone has any advice on how to approach this, or any advice on how to feel at all it would be greatly appreciated.

I (22 F) am struggling to accept my boyfriend’s (22 M) busy schedule after 1 year of dating,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year and he has a corporate job. Since the beginning we have met on the weekends and I’ve expressed my desire to meet more. We just had a fight about this and it was intense - I almost feel like I don’t want to try anymore. 

I understand that he’s busy and must be tired and I’ve suggested a lot of different options. I guess what irks me is my friends who also have 9-5 jobs don’t act like they can’t meet me at all during the week and I personally don’t see why meeting for an hour even is so difficult. I guess my expectations might be a bit much here - but I don’t understand why after a year of dating, I can’t be in his house while he’s not there. Like today I suggested that I come over we hang out and then he can go to the office tomorrow and I can either leave w him or stay at his and then we can spend time together once he’s back from work (I’d obviously let him do this at my place)

Like this is something I’ve even done w my friends for example where they hang out at my place till I’m done w work and once I’m back we’ll chill together so I don’t find anything particularly odd about that - but when I told him this he said that us doing that would be “weird”

I’m frustrated because my girl friends are out of town rn and I only have one guy friend here and he won’t let me hang out w guys (something I’ve never had a problem with) but it’s so frustrating that he won’t hang out w me and won’t let me hang out w someone else and then I just have to sit in my room bored and lonely. 

Also (I do feel bad about this cause I really do care about his family n ik I’m being unreasonable) but he mentioned that he can’t even have one day off from work cause he’s saving his holidays for when he visits his family months later - I got frustrated by this cause all I was asking for was one day (in the span of a year) and I don’t understand why a grown man can’t take one day out for his gf and has to save it all up for visiting his family months later 😭

Two friends (28F) visited me (28F) after years and now I feel like I’ve ruined both friendships — how do I fix things or know if it’s time to let go?,"I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.

T lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.

There were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.

T also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.

The night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”

After she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?

There was another moment that stuck out — when I said I don’t follow people from school on Instagram because I’m not in touch with them anymore (edit). Both of them gave pretty strong reactions to that — it felt judgmental.

To be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown. I felt like I ruined my friendships with both of them and like I’d failed as a host. The whole thing brought up feelings of homesickness I’d been suppressing for years.

# I don’t know how to process this. I feel distant from both friends now, and I’m not sure if I should try to repair things or give them space and move on. How do I approach this — should I reach out and talk to them, or let the distance settle? How do you know when it’s time to let go of friendships that feel different now?

# TL;DR:

Two old friends (28F) visited me (28F). One (T) made me feel attacked and overwhelmed; the other (S) was initially supportive, then seemed distant. I felt like a bad host, had a breakdown after they left, and now I’m wondering how to fix things — or if I should just move on.

I (23F) found sexting messages in my (23M) boyfriends phone on telegram and I don’t know what to do.,"I (23F) found sexting messages in my (23M) boyfriends phone on telegram and I don’t know what to do. 

I have known my boyfriend for almost 10 years now, and we started dating last May so our 1 year is coming up. He also moved in with me in august 2024 so we have been living together for a while now. 

But last night I was sitting on my phone (keep in mind, my bf and I have been in a little rough patch lately, just not on the same wave length which is fine cause that’s normal) but I had this gut feeling that I should go through his phone just because we haven’t been talking a lot lately and things have seemed more off than they have been when we have had these ruts before. 

So I went through his phone and everything just seemed silent in his phone which was odd for him. He’s always had telegram and he uses it for bonuses for games he has and I’ve looked at it before and it’s always been fine. But when I looked last night there had to of been 30-40 different messages of him talking to other women. 

Obviously my heart is racing and so I calmly try and wake him up, and he sees it and he gets up and storms out, and then comes back in and tells me “do you want to know the true reason why I was doing that” and I said “obviously” and he said “I’m embarrassed to tell you this but I’ve been trying to scam people to get money because we have been so down bad” which yes we have been very down bad with $ in our relationship. I unfortunately do not believe him, I will say the messages are only from the past week, they aren’t from a long time ago so this must have been recent. 

I love him very much and our personalities match so well, but I know there are other people out there who wouldn’t do that to me. I hope that I’m not wasting my time trying to fix things with him if I decide to.

Do I stay or go?,"Hi so I’m a 24 F and the guy I’m with is a 25 M. We grew up together and had a relationship for three years before I broke up with him because he had wandering eyes and started to seem just not crazy interested in me, not that he ever treated me bad but he was just immature I think and also wasn’t very honest about how he felt or about things in general. Flash forward 5 years later and we have now been talking for 8 months. To my surprise I actually really like him and think he’s incredibly funny. He treats me so well that the first time I ever saw him he gifted me a really expensive thing telling me how he remembered I wanted it. He does really nice things for me, I have never needed to lift a finger around him, he plans trips, he tells me how much I mean to him, takes me shopping, never complains, etc. I also have yet to catch him in a lie but I have trauma from catching him in the past in lies so I don’t even look at his phone or anything anymore nor do I want to. Anyways even with this new leaf he’s turned I don’t know how I feel. 
He wants to ask me to be his girlfriend and some days or even weeks I’ll feel so good about that but then other times I get anxious thinking about it. When I see him sometimes I feel intense anxiety but I’m not sure if it’s about him or relationships or life. For background I struggle with commiting to anyone and I think this is from a lack of a loving home in my childhood. I experienced a bit of trauma growing up so I don’t love like a normal person would. I don’t really like affection. Not that I can’t show it but I just struggle with it. I’m also not sure if I’m attracted to him physically tho I am definitely attracted to him somewhat, I am more attracted to his personality. 

I also hate the dating field as I’ve been with multiple other people both long term and short but have never actually dated anyone other than him. 
We also have different career paths and could end up in completely different states tho I know this isn’t the worst thing it still worries me.
He is so great and I love him a ton but I don’t know why my brain is struggling. He’d drop anything for me and I wanna do the same but I’m panicking. He’s my best friend and it’s been like that for years. I just don’t know what to do.

Do I (18F) cut my friend(18F) off ?,"I had a friend group last year. This year I wasn't in their class. I had trouble including myself in convos at lunch but tried making efforts. Once I asked to come to a party and they invented an excuse so i didnt come because they didn't want the friend I was bringing. I let that pass and then they were planning a hang out to the skating rink. I couldnt come but nobody asked me. I told them why I couldnt but they didn't care and I didn't think much of it it wasn't a big deal.
But then some days later I learned that one girl was saying that if I came she wouldnt come. I confronted her, and asked my closest friends about it. She told me she was here if I wanted to talk, but didn't it was late at night so she stopped responding. But she never responded to my messages after that. It hurted me but I didn't say anything. 

Fast forward last month I learned that I wasn't invited to a big hang out because I distanced myself too much and the mean girl said that if I was coming she wouldn't come again even though i thought she would stop after talking to her about it. I talked to my closest friend, she told me to get over it (wasn't mean saying it) but I tried to communicate to understand but she would disregard a lot a my messages. About the thing the girl said she said that she couldnt ask me to hang out because some people didnt want me there, but admitted that i was progressively excluded from hang outs. Also, i asked why she wasnt telling me what was happening, she told me that i already knew everything and that i knew more than her about the story. Didn't have the chance to talk more about the subject as she wanted to stop talking about it. I thought that maybe I didn't communicate enough beforehand but I just found out texts from just a few days after learning all about the first exclusion where I complained about being excluded and that nobody was doing anything about it. My closest friend saw it but never responded. It really makes me want to just stop talking to her as we already don't talk much. But she is also the only one in the group to do efforts for my bd and stated multiple times that she didn't us to drift apart.
 
Moreover, she complained multiples times last year that she didn't feel included in the group and I always reassured her and at least asked if she was coming to some hang outs
 
I feel like im becoming crazy as the only mean girl in the group was the one I talked about in the beginning. My friend was a nice person so I can't help but thinking I might do a mistake cutting her of but I can't help but ressent her now

Girlfriend (42F) of 5 years prioritizes other people over me (38M),"I am (38M) who has dated my gf (42F) for 5 years now (met in 2020). Since we dated, I had to plan everything from dates to trips. I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.

To add more insight, I had schedule this trip at a specific time frame that worked best for her and her friends. This time frame pretty inconvenient for me since I go back to work the following day I come back from the trip. I've had to plan dates around her friends schedule since I met her. Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people. I am at a point where I am constantly thinking about ending things but worried this is trivial or non-issue thing to complain about. I can't see myself dealing with this anymore.

I [29F] have lost attraction to my [27NB] disabled partner and I'm at a loss for what to do.,"My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.

They started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.

They are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.

"I (23M) can't handle distance, girlfriend (22F) is fine with it. Am I being too harsh on her?","Hi friends )

I apologize for my rough English, it is not my first language.

So, my girlfriend and I are both international students from Slovakia. We get along pretty great and have lots in common, but one main difference is that I feel at home here, while she still feels like her home is back there. I believe that over the years I have grown accustomed to this culture, its language, its food, and its sports (go Cubs!) but not she.

That would be fine but there's more. Due to her feeling that way, she travels home constantly. She spends one, two, or even three months with her family back home. While I do miss my parents, my brother and I understand they made a huge effort sending us to study abroad, so we don't really feel the need to go back. We owe it to them to make a life here. Parents feel the same way.

I told her before that I can't handle long distance, she said she understood. But now it's been almost a year of us being together but she going home for months, sometimes I feel like we are not together anymore. Makes it seem she didn't care about respecting my limits. Makes me confused. But on the other hand, I don't want to say to her to not go home, that would be rude and controlling, she is a great girl and I wouldn't want to make her sad.

I just fear things will not be the same when she gets back. That we will have grown apart too much, due to pretty much being out of each other's lives for 1/4 of a year. She thinks we should try a different approach this time, so we don't grow apart, like videochatting more often, but I don't think that will change much. She's either here or she's not.

Anxiety/ocd in relationship,"I’m NB22 and my bf is M21. We’ve been together for almost a year now and we’re long distance. We keep coming up with this issue where I feel like I am the one to complain/nag about everything in the relationship bc I’m brutally honest, communicative, and impulsive w my emotions/thoughts. Sometimes I hold it in to process, but at times he asks me what’s wrong and I say it. On his hand, he gets anxiety or a deep fear that if he communicates how he feels/thinks then I will break up with him or judge him. He is emotionally closed off in most situations.. and has lied to me to “protect me” or how I feel. This leads to us having emotional outbursts and very overwhelming conversations or arguments bc he waits until last minute to tell me how he feels. I have acknowledged and apologized for the things I’ve said but it’s not good enough. I just want to be better for him. 

Tl;dr how can I make my boyfriend feel more comfortable and vulnerably open about his emotions?",1,1kwr5gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kwr5gj/anxietyocd_in_relationship/
Cutting ties with family member who is hosting an important family function - what should I do?,"Throwaway bc I don’t want family to find this. 

There’s a lot of necessary backstory so bear with me. TLDR at the bottom. 

I (34F) and my husband (35m) have two daughters (1.5, 3mo). We are currently living in my childhood home with my dad (78m) and my sister (32F). We decided to move in when we were expecting my first daughter which was soon after my mom passed away. It is a huge help for us financially to be here as I am a SAHM now and our previous apartment would have been very tough to afford on one income and it also was not going to be a good environment for babies. We do not formally pay rent but we cover almost all food costs for everyone, I cook meals, and my husband and I have taken over some of the tasks around the house that are getting too difficult for my dad to do. Everyone in the house is happy with this arrangement. A big factor in us moving in was also the fact that my mom had passed and we wanted more family to be around my dad. He has no friends (by choice) and even with my sister around (she works a lot and is not often home) we all didn’t feel comfortable with how much alone time he would have. My mom was his life and we didn’t know what he would do with his time moving forward and he also needs more looking after due to his old age. When I brought up the idea of my family moving in to my dad, he said he had been planning on extending the invitation for us to come live there so it was a mutual decision. 

A couple months after my mom passed away, my older half brother (53 M - same dad) with whom I had a previously positive but distant relationship with, started making comments to my sister about how my husband and I were freeloaders by moving into the house and taking up so much space. My brother has never lived in this house and I was obviously hurt when my sister told me about these comments because I felt it wasn’t true about our situation but also it isn’t his business. At this point we hadn’t moved in yet but the plans were pretty much set. My brother never said anything to me about it but my sister showed me texts he sent her that were really negative and strongly worded. I mentioned this to my dad and his response was that it wasn’t my brother’s business and that he wanted my family to come move in. I tried to let the comments go and we moved on. 

Fast forward a year and a half later to now. Over the last year and a half, my brother has made some other comments to me disguised as jokes that I haven’t appreciated. It’s obvious to me that he looks down on me and doesn’t like me very much, which I hadn’t ever felt before the whole housing situation. Pretty suddenly a few months ago, he reached out saying that he felt tension and didn’t know why and wanted to talk about it in person, just the two of us. I met up with him and that conversation was basically a two hour monologue of him saying how unwanted he felt by the family because of things my mom did and said before I was born. Of course I don’t know what actually happened but when I told my dad this, he said none of those things were true. Keep in mind all of this is very upsetting to hear considering my mom has recently passed away and my brother’s mom is still alive. In the same conversation he said that he wanted us to be closer and basically insinuated that the reason we haven’t been closer in the past was my mom keeping us apart (not true based on what I saw growing up). 

We recently met again to have another conversation at his request and I basically said I didn’t know what would be possible for us in terms of a closer relationship because of what he said about me and my husband concerning us moving in. He very quickly said he was just making sure my dad was happy with the arrangement and that he said nothing negative and blamed my sister for spinning it into a negative story. He said he felt used by my sister and it was clearly her fault for putting thoughts in my head. After the conversation I talked to my sister who showed me the texts again and it’s clear my brother is lying. He had been saying again and again how honesty was important and we were all going to have to be truthful to have a good relationship moving forward so the lies hurt even more because of that. I had been wondering why he wasn’t reaching out to my sister about having a closer relationship and without me asking, he said it’s because I have kids and he wants to be a present uncle. I get that but it also made me feel like the means to an end. 

I have decided to explicitly say I can’t have a close relationship with him for the above reasons, as well as various smaller boundaries that have been crossed. I have a text drafted and I’m going to include screenshots of his texts as proof that he lied to me. Based on what he has expressed, I need to be explicit about this and can’t just distance myself because he said he will keep pushing to be involved. 

Now the issue is when I should do it. His son (who I don’t have a relationship with and he blames me and my late mom for that) is graduating from college and we’ve all been invited to the ceremony and a party in a month. Up until now I had been planning on going because I knew it was important to my brother. I think my nephew could probably care less if I were there or not. The main reason I don’t know about just not going is that my dad’s ex (brothers mom) will be there and my dad has absolutely no desire to see her or interact with her. Based on what I know about her I don’t blame him. It’s important that he goes to this event snd I don’t want to leave him high and dry with her there and I don’t know if just my sister will be enough of a buffer. My dad wants to stay out of this drama between my brother and I and won’t really comment on it and I know if I ask him what he thinks I should do about going to graduation, he will not give a real answer and just will want to avoid having to deal with it. 

TLDR; I have decided to tell a family member we can’t have a close relationship but he is hosting an important family function. Do I tell him and not go or wait until after the function to say something? I don’t want to be two-faced but also don’t want to cause more family drama and tension.

Advice? F 20 M 20,"
Me (F 20) and my boyfriend (M 20) have been dating for almost 10 months. I have issues trusting him and sometimes check his messages even though I have never found anything. He used to Snapchat a girl that he is friends with in the beginning of our relationship but has since deleted Snapchat. He also wore a bracelet that she made him for the first couple months of our relationship but he says he used to have tons of friendship bracelets from different friends and they have all since fallen off.


Tonight I asked about this friend because I haven't seen a message from her in months. He told me that he heard from her a few weeks ago on Instagram but deleted the message because ""he knew I would freak out"". I am more upset that he deleted the message than that they were even messaging. Now I'm wondering what else he has deleted and why he felt the need to delete it if it was genuinely just a friendly check in.

Tldr: boyfriend deleted messages and didn't tell me",0,1kwowt3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kwowt3/advice_f_20_m_20/
Me M21 and GF F21 won't stop being friend with a guy she had feelings for,"We've been dating for 15 months. She's my first love, and I truly care about her. Over this time, she has asked for many commitments from me—emotionally and in the relationship—and I’ve always given them without hesitation because I love her deeply.

Before we got together, there was a guy she used to like. They were never officially in a relationship but were physically involved (though not sexually). It was more of a situationship. Later on, she confronted him about how she felt, and he told her he didn’t feel the same. That same month, she met me. I fell in love with her pretty quickly, and after four months, we officially started dating.

Since the beginning, I was never comfortable with her staying in contact with that guy. Any other person in my place would probably feel the same. She wasn’t happy about it at first, but she removed him from her social media. I appreciated that. But a month later, I noticed she added him back. When I confronted her, we argued, and she removed him again.

This cycle repeated 3–4 times over the months.

Then, on a random day, she told me that she had removed him again—not because she wanted to, but because I didn’t like it. I still appreciated the gesture and felt happy that maybe she finally understood how I felt.

But four months later, she added him back again. This time it really broke me.

When I confronted her about it, she said she has no feelings for him at all, that she only loves me, and doesn’t care about him. She even said she never went out with him, and he means nothing to her now.

I asked her, “Then why do you keep adding him back?”

She got emotional and told me she didn’t have an answer. She said she doesn’t know why she does that and started calling herself characterless, saying she felt bad about it. She apologized and said, “Tell me what I need to do. I don’t care about him. I only care about you.”

Despite her saying all of this, I feel incredibly hurt. This is the most painful moment I’ve had in this entire relationship. I feel confused, anxious, and somewhere deep down, played. I don’t even know what to say to her now. I don’t know what to ask her to do, because this isn’t something that should happen in a committed relationship.

I need advice, clarity, and support. What should I do? Specifically from girls, what am I missing here, what am I doing wrong


TL;DR:
My girlfriend keeps adding a guy from her past back on social media even though she knows it hurts me deeply. She says she has no feelings for him, apologizes, and doesn't know why she does it. I feel hurt, confused, and anxious. I don’t know what to say or ask from her anymore.

Is my bf overreacting?,"(I'm not an English speaker.. sorry if it's confusing. I'm willing to elaborate if needed.)

Me 17F and my boyfriend 17M are in a pretty happy relationship for about 5 months now. We argue a lot but we resolve it afterwards. But lately, it's been really hard since it's about boys. He's been pretty clear that I shouldn't be too close because he said that I dont have any spacial awareness and I can be too physically close to them. Me and him are classmates so he sees what I'm doing with the others.

Here is an example scenario: We're having a group activity and I'm the leader so I gotta talk to everyone fast because we only have 5 minutes. My bf was upset and said when I talk to my groupmates that are boys I'm so close to them like I have no personal space at all. I explained that I am that way since the beginning and I was just talking to them in a rush but that's not working. 

My bf said when I have a problem he'll change immediately without a doubt. That made me feel guilty so I said I'll change but he said it can't happen again otherwise it's gameover. We had a big argument about this and he said hurtful words. 

For me, it's really hard because I really couldn't control how I act or talk especially when I'm in a rush. I really love him and want to work things out with him but I feel scared because what if I accidentally forgot. I requested for him to have more patience but he said changing is pointless if I forget. 


So, should I do what he said or is he making things complicated?

I don't have spacial awareness and my boyfriend has a huge problem with that. ",2,1kwmzhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kwmzhl/is_my_bf_overreacting/
My bf(23m) told me (21f) that pls don't blame him when we won't work in the future during our LDR,"

We have been in a relationship since Sep of last year.
And we've been physically separated each other since this Jan. He lives in Europe and I live in Asia.
Once a day out of blue he told me ""someday we might not work anymore when we choose to go live another country"" you might wanna work in Usa and If I work in UK. then it will be hard for us to keep this relationship.
Of course we should try our best, but don't blame me pls when this happens. So I asked him then what if I live in your country after I graduate? and he told me l'd be obviously happier when you come here sooner but don't dare to choose to do just bc of me. cause l'm not a perfect person and I can hurt you someday I don't wanna do that. And your life is yours so I cannot suggest anything about your life and your career bc my parents taught me that way. I always have been taught that big decision in your life is yours. and that's why I cannot suggest you anything but I might change my mind someday and pressure you to come here when I feel confident




So basically he don't want commit anything to me. but for now obviously want to keep this relationships even deciding to coming here during his holidays. His entire words just makes me so confused. basically he is almost my first love and l've always drawn our future and dedicated to him always learning english so I can communicate with him better. And he is now telling me nothing clear about our future just avoiding any of his responsibility. Although I told him I'll try my best caring texting you and we can do it He replied me kinda overly pessimistic and realistic about our future relationship .
And I feel I'm loosing feeling over him cause I found myself cannot trust him anymore and dream us together in the future.. but I still love him so much caring him so much and we're meeting end of June to spend holiday together in other asian country. What should I do in this case...?? should I tell him about my feeling before our holidays? or after that? I don't even get clue or anything about this relationship

TL;DR : My bf don’t want to commit anything or wanna promise about our future but for now wanna keep this relationship talking about a near future. I’m so anxious thinking about him all day ever since he talked that way. what should I do?

I [18F] don't know how to tell my [18M] boyfriend that I need him to be more attentive.,"TL,DR: I don't think my boyfriend is showing me enough attention and isn't picking up any hints, and I always have to tell him everything in order for him to actually do something for me. How do I bring it up without whining/complaining too much, since we had a pretty similar conversation about the same topic not too long ago?




I have a loving boyfriend. We've been friends for a few years before getting together, and he was so much better than my other friends at the time because we could bond over shared bad/traumatic experiences, but also general taste, opinions, thoughts and so on. 
We got together 7 months ago, and while we had a few problems here and there, we worked through them as we promised to communicate calmly. However, I may he holding a grudge still and I'm here for opinions and advice.

For our 6 month anniversary (which I find quite special cus you know,, half a year and all), I made him a nice present and bought him a book - nothing fancy but still personal and I did put in effort. He bought me nothing. He didn't get me anything for our 5 month anniversary either, but I was fine with both as I enjoyed his company and I don't really need material things or gifts from him to feel loved, and besides, he already got me nice gifts for our first month together. But then again, is it that difficult to get/make a small thing? Or make/buy a small, spontaneous gift without me always having to ask? He's awkward and somewhat insecure, afraid of making mistakes or ""driving me away"" (despite me repeatedly telling him that I genuinely couldn't care less about what gift he gets me/makes me as long it's not something I openly hate. I love him to death). I told him how I felt hurt about some stuff and needed him to pick up hints and notice behaviours or patterns that I do when I'm, for example, upset (which are very obvious and we've discussed them thoroughly a few times, even before we got together). He apologised and said he'd try and notice more and be there for me in the future, so we soothed that out - or so I thought, I guess.

I've had a urinary infection not too long ago and I've only recently recovered from it, but I got sick a few days ago (a somewhat serious cold but nothing dangerous) which is making me exhausted and irritable. I've been having check-ups and talks with the doctors at least twice a week these past few weeks because of both the urinary infection and now the cold, and not once has he offered on his own to even keep me company. Which I find hurtful.

I understand that he's busy with his school and that maybe he's not in the mood to get out of the house or something, but it still hurts that he doesn't even offer help or to visit me. A few times he just outright forgot or ignored that I'm sick, until I reminded him. He hasn't gotten me anything to eat/drink when I invited him to come over (and only because it was also convenient for him, and he used to get me stuff, especially sweets and food like that before). 
But whatever, that's fine. But he also seems.. uncaring, or disinterested. Is it really that hard to just reply to my message telling him I'm going to the hospital because I feel like shit and my health isn't improving with more than ""owww, rest up""? Is saying something like ""I'm busy/tired/whatever today but if I could, I'd keep you company"" really that difficult, even if it's a lie? 
It's literally the same aforementioned talk about attention and spontaneous acts of kindness (whether physical, verbal, in terms of gifts) that we had. And I'm tired of always asking things of people, especially of him. When he's sick, I make sure to buy him his favourite snacks, to cuddle with him, to offer to take care of him and try to do it should the circumstances allow. But he just doesn't return the favour despite me telling him, more than once, that I'd appreciate such things, even if just an attempt or offer. I don't get why, and if I'm just an asshole or seeking attention. I don't know how to tell him all of this without sounding like I'm whining/complaining too much. How do I tell him, what do I do? How do I communicate properly with him and let him know?
Any help/advice is appreciated, sorry for the long ass post.

how to deal with a drastic change in quality time?,"hi everyone, me (19M) and my bf (21m) have been dating for a year, since the start i had known he wasnt very talkitive but i still thought he was responsive to me and we had conversations, however recently i have realised  my expecations arent being met, these expecations being having good communication, responsible spending, lots of pda etc. everything was good to begin with and had been until recently when my partner and i had to stop seeing eachother at his parents house ( we both live with out parents respectivly). this was very damaging because we spent most of our time inside and my family home was off limits too and so now we could only see eachother outside. since then we have gone from spending most days together and tg all weekned to seeing eachother for once an hour every other day. i dont think i can cope with this difference. more context is that we both dont drive but live like 15 minutes away from eachother so it is easy to see eachother but he has been sleeping all day due to his bad sleep schedule and it gets really cold at night so we cant go out during that time either. idk what to do about this, any advice?

my boyfriends (18M) family dislikes me (19F) because of something that happened almost two years ago.,"i (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for almost two years now. ever since we started dating his parents and his older sister has made it painfully clear that they do not like me. 

background: me and my current boyfriend started dating his junior year and my senior year of high school. previous to that we were good friends. i had been dating one of his friends my sophomore year until beginning of senior year until i broke it off because the things we wanted in life were completely different and i didn’t see it working out in the future. i began dating my current boyfriend (ill call him will) in april of my senior year. even before we started dating, his parents and my ex’s parents were good friends and when they realized i was with will, they began to dislike me. at first, it was just his mom. she would tell him things saying that i was not a good person for dating his friend and then him (which i know could come off as wrong but there was no unfaithfulness while dating my ex), and saying that she doesn’t want him dating me. he stood up to her in the beginning until she started taking some drastic measures and at one point even came to me and begged me to stop being with her son. we broke up a couple times due to him not wanting to upset his parents but always got back together because we still loved each other. there was one time where they found out we were sexually active and his parents threatened to tell my parents everything that i had done and what has been going on. there was also another time where i had went to his house to just pick him up to grab some food, and his sister came up to me and basically told me i was immature and she had “gone through something similar and knew that we wouldn’t work out” as well as yelling and crying telling me to leave will. i left and let him deal with his sister but during that time it mentally impacted me heavily so i just decided to distance myself to not see his family at all. 

now to real time: 
**TL;DR** his sister currently also has a boyfriend who is the same race as me so i know it’s not a race thing, and they treat him so well. they invite him to dinners, take him on family trips, and whatnot. i’m currently a upcoming sophomore in college and he is about to graduate. we did long distance for a year and made it through. my boyfriend and i’s relationship is great, we have no problems and plan on staying together and potentially moving in together in college (if his parents allow). it just bothers me because even though he’s about to leave for college, his parents still try to control how much time he spends with me or even how late he stays out (sometimes telling him to come home at like 10pm when he has nothing else to do the next day). his mom in my eyes has been manipulating him as she’ll make subtle “jokes” to try to get him to go home and at one point before we started dating, would cry to him about being depressed because he was going against what she told him to do. i’ve been dealing with it up until now, but in my eyes, he’s about to head off to college and his mom is still trying to control how much time he spends with me. i’m also planning on transferring to the same college he is going to (not solely for him but for my major) and it’s just frustrating. he doesn’t want to always do what his mom says but he will sometimes cave when it comes to his mom controlling when he’s out with me. i don’t want his family to continue disliking me but i also don’t know how to especially get his mom to change her opinion about me, so im not sure what to do at this point. are there any tips i can do?",1,1kwj84m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kwj84m/my_boyfriends_18m_family_dislikes_me_19f_because/

My (19M) boyfriend has been giving me (19F) extreme mixed signals.,"I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (19M) for 2 years. Throughout our relationship, my boyfriend has always been relatively good with consistent love. We would have deep talks at night, wish each other a good morning, see each other at school, and make sacrifices to see each other, even just for a minute. It's also important to note that my boyfriend has been diagnosed with ASPD, so I've always been mindful that expressing certain feelings may be hard (we have had several long talks about it), and it's never seemed to be an issue in our relationship.

However, over the past couple of months, my boyfriend has suddenly been giving me extreme mixed signals. It's a long story - but our school, alongside other schools (we are a small town, so we conjoined with others) went to Greece. His distance started there, where he seemingly avoided me, wouldn't smile or express any emotions with me, and wouldn't even make eye contact. I tried my best to give him space while remaining loving, but even after the trip, the distance didn't subside. I eventually confronted him over it, and he ended up sobbing and apologizing. He promised to change. However, since then, he has still been very off. Whenever we are in public (at school, at functions, really anywhere with other people) he seems emotionless when I'm around. He talks quietly, avoids PDA (we also talked about this, in which he told me he definitely enjoys PDA), and often doesn't smile or make eye contact. I often feel like a lost puppy and an after-thought, as he smiles and laughs freely with his other friends. However, in private (calling at night or hanging out), he behaves as I have always known him. He even talks about how much he cares about me, and how excited he is for 'our future' (although sometimes he is distant when the future comes up). Ive also noticed other behaviors which I find confusing, like being distant during our good mornings, ignoring my texts, prioritizing hobbies (he does jujitsu for the majority of the week and will often prefer to partake in that or other sports than seeing me), which of course is fine, but believe me, ITS WEIRD! This emotional whiplash has gotten me so confused, so I brought it up to him a couple days ago, but nothing seemed to come of it.

Some of you must be thinking; ""Just break up!"". I CANNOT DO THAT. Some reasons include; I love this boy so much and definitely am not at the point of leaving, (I also have diagnosed depression and anxiety and the loneliness would not do me well), we live in a small town, so he is in every one of my classes. We are also NEIGHBOURS. I do not have any friends to fall back upon (yes, i have friends, but they're not exactly good people to me, and I can't 'find a better crowd'. Its a very small school... so they kind of are the crowd).

I love him so much, and I just want to understand what's been going on lately. I completely understand that the first step would be to communicate, but I've already done so, and this week would not be a good week to try again. I keep spoiling him with gifts, like flowers, hand written notes, jewelry, hoping it may help (I know its not, haha). Ive been as supportive as I can with all of his extracurriculars. I just don't know whats been going on, or how to fix it. Help.

TLDR: My boyfriend has been distant for a few months. In public, he avoids me and doesn't express PDA. In private, he can be very loving, kind, and the relationship is normal. He doesn't prioritize me. He has ASPD and I have depression. Breaking up is not an option.

Continue living with boyfriend or leave?,"My boyfriend [26M] and I [25F] have been together for 3 and a half years. We are both from California and met in college. We moved together during his last semester. That’s when I also started working in my field. It’s a healthcare related career. After our lease ended and he graduated, he had a job lined up in Texas. I decided to live with my parents and he decided to move and take the job in Texas. I understand that he had to do what is best for him. We wanted to maintain our relationship. I continued working in California and living with my parents, though it started to become difficult for us to do long distance. I decided to move to Texas to be with him. I found a new job out there and started grad school too. My program was a year and a half and it is coming to an end. I initially thought moving to Texas may make him consider if he wanted to be with me long term or not. Before moving, I made it very clear of what I want for my future in a relationship and my reasons for moving out there. He knew I want to be engaged sooner rather than later, especially moving for our relationship. He agreed and we seemed to be on the same page. 
Fast forward to today, we are not engaged/ at the point in our relationship that I had hoped/ want us to be. I’m about to graduate, but I want to pursue my career in California rather than Texas. For my field, California has better opportunities and I would need a license in each state I practice in. Getting a license in CA would be a long/difficult process if I stay in TX. My boyfriend wants to stay in TX for at least another year for his job’s vesting period before looking for a new job. He is open to moving back to CA after that. He had told me he will propose within the next year and that I should trust him. I was sad and upset that he still never proposed to me after all this time. A part of me doesn’t know for sure if he will actually purpose in the timeframe he mentioned. I’m contemplating moving back to California to focus on myself and give him more to think about what he wants. Or should I stay in TX and get the license for my career here in hopes that he will propose soon and in hopes that we will eventually move back to California?

Gf(23) wants Me(25) to give her a second chance,"[English is not my first language] Me(25y) my gf(23y), I never expected something like this to happen, no one I guess… But here it goes: Today my gf confessed she cheated on me 8 months ago, we have a 5 year relationship, this year she went to a different college for her masters and she plays in those philarmonic bands on her hometown.

She decided today to tell me, started saying we are two different persons,  we don’t communicate that good after she went to college cause distance, (college here starts on September), and then saying it in the end she messed up.

Her version: there was this philarmonic halloween band party 8 months ago she got a bit drunk and kissed a guy(the guy is younger then her, don’t know the age but looks a kid on his 19s)from there. She said felt guilty but didn’t told me, she has been talking to the guy till now on instagram, cause they are on the same band.

Btw this talk was on a discord call, I was to shocked so I talk normally, asked stuff but do you still talk to him? do you like him?(she said no) She said she still loves me and this all was a mistake and she did something stupid.

The thing hard for me to understand is why she do it, why did she told me 8 months after and why does she still talks with him…

She cried a lot I stayed broken inside, this is hell Im lost i talked to friends, i could understand maybe the kiss thing if she called me after on the same day, this happened, but she kept a secret and talked with the guy on instagram.

I really like her, i buy her flowers a lot, make her pancakes with strawberries in the morning, i always try to find a game or a board game for us, movie night, etc On this last months that we weren’t together that often, Sometimes she would cry when i would hug her while sleeping and take my hand off, but most of the times i assumed it was bad mood.

I also asked her to remove the guy from her life, social media and for her to give me time 

hope anyone can give guidance.

Tl;dr: Gf wants me to give her a second chance after she confessed today that she kissed a guy 8 months ago on a philarmonic band party and still talks with him after 8 months.

My (27F) friend (28F) always needs to be the center of attention and I’m starting to resent her for it,"
Hi everyone, I wanted to get some advice on how to not engage with my friend when she starts acting this way. 

I’ve been friends with a girl for about 5 years now. We are very close and I consider her one of my best friends. However, one of her biggest flaws is that she always needs the attention to be on her in a group setting. She’s great one-on-one, we have fun together and have supported each other through our roughest times. But when she gets around large groups, I cannot stand her. She’ll very obviously flirt with men and then be shocked when they start to like her. She blatantly flirted with my ex in front of me (not because she likes him but because his attention was on me and she would do anything for it to be on herself) but she’ll do these things in a strategically subtle way where if someone points it out they’ll look the crazy one. 

The worst thing for me about this is birthdays. We went to dinner for my birthday last year and she had recently broken up with her boyfriend. She told me the story earlier that day, and she didn’t seem sad at all about it, at least outwardly.  At dinner, she decided to spill the news about the breakup to the rest of the group, and spent basically the whole dinner talking in detail about the story. I left feeling really unappreciated but didn’t say anything because I wanted to be there for her. Last week was another one of my friends’ birthday and we went to dinner. She had been apartment hunting for a while and recently found a suitable apartment to move into. Again, she told me this earlier in the day and she showed me the virtual tour and talked in detail about the location, looked at it on Google earth, etc. But then at dinner, she decided to drop the news that she found a new apartment to the group and everyone asked to see it and she ended up giving everyone the virtual tour again on her phone, until we got our food which was about 45 mins. Meanwhile it seemed like no one was paying any attention to the birthday girl. I tried diverting the topic to ask the birthday girl something and my friend always found a way to bring the conversation back herself. The frustrating part is that I feel like I’m the only one who sees it happening - everyone else indulges in her behavior. 

Well, my birthday is coming up next week and we are all going to dinner. She will just have gotten back from a big trip to a national park. I have been feeling kind of down and unappreciated lately and I am just afraid that my entire birthday dinner is going to revolve solely around her trip, and everyone will want to hear all about her trip and it won’t even feel like a birthday dinner. I want to know how I can handle this - is there a way that I can not indulge in her story to make her tell it faster or for it to not be the main topic of conversation? Any tips on how to handle this?

TLDR: My friend has a habit of always redirecting a conversation back to herself and her life, particularly on days centered around other people, like birthdays. How do I prevent this on my upcoming birthday?",16,1kwcg5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kwcg5o/my_27f_friend_28f_always_needs_to_be_the_center/
(F26) (M28) The same fights,"I’ve been in my relationship almost 4 years. We do not live together. Both work full time and saving to buy a house. 


TL;DR, Our fights for the last two if not more years have been the same over and over. Fight topics: He thinks I’m mean to him, don’t show him enough affection, don’t see each other enough, I always have something wrong with my health, I say things too blunt, always do what I want, never check in on him ect.. 


The main issue is his communion in this relationship he’s the type of person to hold everything in and blow up out of the blue or play the silent game when he’s upset. Me on the other hand I say it like it is regardless of who I’m talking to. I’m in therapy and we talk about the relationship sometimes and I feel like she gives me good advice. (No my boyfriend would never go) Good communication takes two people and I know this is something we must work on. 


I’ve taken all of my money out of our house account because I can’t buy a house with someone who doesn’t know how to communicate when things are wrong in a relationship without always pointing blame, starting a bigger argument or playing the silent game. I would say on average we fight 1-2 times a month over these same topics. I’m really at a loss. ",1,1kwcdzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kwcdzd/f26_m28_the_same_fights/
Should I pursue a friendship with an insecure person?,"I (35F) recently made a new friend, Kira (35F). We are in the early stages of a friendship. She seems really nice, but I've noticed that she also seems insecure. Which is a bit of a red flag for me and I'm not sure if I should continue to build a relationship with her.

Kira is a stay at home mom of 4 kids. She has a beautiful family and a great life (or so it appears to me).

I pursued post secondary education and have a professional career in my field of study. I have a spouse and we are child free. My spouse and I love to travel and we travel every year for about 1 month.

Kira seems insecure about the fact she doesn't have a post secondary degree, doesn't have a career, and doesn't travel as much as I do.

Neither of our life choices are right or wrong, they are just different. And that's fine. 

When Kira and I spend time together, we hardly talk about my career or travel. But she has made enough comments that it's clear she is insecure about these things. 

Is this a big enough red flag that I shouldn't continue to build a relationship with her? Or is it minor enough that I can ignore it? She seems really nice otherwise.

"Me (M27) and my partner (F20) struggle to have flowing conversation, but are otherwise perfect together","We have been together for almost a year now and on paper everything is perfect. We both share a love of classic cars, listen to the same music and going to concerts together, love cooking good food together, love gaming, playing card games in pubs and going out for coffee and cake; the list could go on. I should also add that our sex life and attraction for each other couldn't be stronger. But the issue that has been really starting to wear me down is that I've become so aware that when we're not actively doing something we really struggle making conversation. 

My partner isn't very talkative, and I consider myself a bit more of a 'listener' too, so I often need other people to drive conversation so I can riff off of them, and it seems like she is the same. But this means that when we sit across from each other over dinner or in a cafe we just don't have any form of meaningful conversation. We might comment on things we like, i.e. ""this coffee is great"", ""I like his boots over there"", ""I can't believe how lucky we've been with the weather"", but it's just not stimulating in the slightest, and I feel like I desperately yearn for good, meaningful conversation to feel truly close to someone and to get to know them deeply. I want us to riff off of each other and to lose time to our long chats.

  
This is the first time in my life I've ever dated someone much younger than myself, and I suspect a lot of it has to do with my partner being less adept in casual conversation, and perhaps the conversation I find stimulating is simply boring to her, hence why it doesn't even occur to her to talk about. 

  
What could a possible solution be? Has anyone else experienced a similar issue and made it work with their significant other? Is this the sign of a doomed relationship/ an incompatibility?   

It's beginning to effect how I feel about my partner as it's all I can focus on when we're together, as I'm constantly screaming in my head, ""what do we talk about???""

  
TL;DR: Me and my partner struggle to have flowing conversation but are otherwise a fantastic match, what can we do to work on this? ",0,1kw8b25,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kw8b25/me_m27_and_my_partner_f20_struggle_to_have/
Conflicted after a night out with a longtime friend (25f) and I (26m) need an outside perspective,"I’m not really sure why I’m posting this or if this is even the right subreddit, but I guess I just need some outside opinions. I can’t seem to get this off my mind, and I don’t feel comfortable talking to my friends about it.

I’ll try to keep this as simple as possible, though the full context would take pages.

Basically, I was hanging out with a girl I’ve been friends with for over 10 years. We were drinking together. She’s known to get a little wild when she drinks, but the night started out great. It felt like she had a lot to get off her chest—we hadn’t seen each other in a while, so she was also catching me up on her life. I was just trying to be a good listener and give her advice.

After the bar closed, we went to my friend’s house. By this point, I was already pretty drunk, but I felt like she was even drunker (she’s a small girl, I’m a big guy). I actually started trying to drink more just to be on her level, but she kept trying to take the bottle from me and I wasn’t trying to let her drink any more.

At one point, she fell onto my lap, looked me in the eyes, said my name, and said:
“I’ve always had a crush on you. Kiss me.”
Then she tried to kiss me.

I didn’t kiss her. Partially because my friend was in the room watching and laughing—it was cramped—and partially because I didn’t feel comfortable with the situation morally. She’s in a long-term relationship and lives with her boyfriend.

This is where I’m conflicted:
Was she just drunk and saying random stuff, or does the fact that she looked me dead in the eyes, said my name, and said she had a crush on me mean it was real?

Later that night, she drank more while I was in the bathroom and was completely gone. I had the sense to take her down the street to my place. Without going into too much detail—we ended up just spooning and falling asleep. Nothing happened, even though she was still acting wild.

I hate this feeling because I genuinely love her, but it’s always been as a friend. Now it’s weighing heavy on my heart. We’ve always been the type to say “I love you” to each other, even when we haven’t hung out in a while. I just don’t know how to process what happened.

The next morning, we got breakfast. She ended up getting into a big fight with her boyfriend over the phone and left. She also said some things that made me worry about her mental health—like she doesn’t really care about her own safety.

The last time we spoke was when I texted her the day after. She replied:
“Love you forever. I’ll reach out soon.”

Now I don’t know what to do. If we hang out again and drink, and she starts flirting—do I bring up what she said? Should I admit that I’ve always had a bit of a crush on her too?

A big part of me feels like there’s no way she’s had feelings for me this whole time. But the way she looked at me made me question that. I feel torn.

Should I just stop answering her calls—maybe I’m not good for her life right now? Or should I step up, be better, and try to help her be happy? I’m supposed to be in my “grind era,” focusing on myself, but now my head is all messed up.

⸻

TL;DR:

Had a deep night out drinking with a close female friend of 10+ years. She drunkenly confessed she’s always had a crush on me and tried to kiss me—even though she’s in a long-term relationship. I stopped things and took care of her, but now I’m torn. I’ve always loved her as a friend, but now I’m questioning everything. I don’t know whether to distance myself or open up and be there for her.",0,1kw5upp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kw5upp/conflicted_after_a_night_out_with_a_longtime/
Help-Am I a bad person? Did I ruin my girlfriend’s life?,"I (F16) and my girlfriend (F17) have been dating for almost 2 years. Our relationship started out well she was my brother’s best friend and that’s how her and I met. and at that point I had very little to no friends, I had 2 who at the time didn’t treat me well and so aboht 4 months into my relationship my
girlfriend pushed me into dropping them. The beginning of this school year I became friends with one of them again after my girlfriend told me not to I do acknowledge I was in the wrong for ignoring that factor but she never had given me a proper reason why I shouldn’t. The friend had clearly grown as a person and I strictly kept the friendship at school in that one class she was still fuming when she found out we were speaking.

When her and I began to date her friends gradually became my friends. And I would sometimes vent to them about her and i’s relationship, She would do a lot of things that were alarming or hurt me in many ways. Such as getting angry with me for spending too much time away from her (an hour). She would get mad if I would spend too long downstairs with my mother, my mom and I have always been very very close and got even closer ever since my father passed away suddenly. Or she would just be flat out mean to me and speak to me in a rude manner and make me feel flat out terrible about myself. And as time went on my girlfriend herself started to isolate herself from her friends. And they didn’t really prevent it either because they didn’t like how she treats me and acts toward me.

My brother and her gradually stopped being friends, they just drifted apart in their own ways. A lot of is it atoned to the fact he didn’t like the way she was treating and speaking to me. The biggest incident was when she yelled at me in school in front of others for speaking to that friend (that I mentioned earlier). And she despises him somewhat she doesn’t like for me to talk about him or be around him honestly. But either way he’s my brother and he will be in my life no matter what, we are still very close. But I let her know this information not too long ago and she didn’t know it I guess she didn’t put the pieces together about the timeline of it all. And she is blaming me and our relationship for her losing all of her friends. 

She made me feel as if I somewhat ruined her entire life and that she just resents me and regrets getting with me. Please let me know what I can do to fix this if possible. I’ve apologized in any possible way I could and she says she doesn’t want any apologies. 

TL;DR: my girlfriend is making me feel as if all of her problems are because of me and our relationship. Such as losing friends, losing herself, and becoming a “bad” person. What do I do?

Need advice for the next step,"(Apologies for a long post)

I(21M) am dating this girl(21F), we both belong to the same hometown, and we met at our college which is almost 2000kms from our hometown. Now, we have been together for almost 1 and ½ year now, and mostly for the last year we are almost in a live-in relationship, as our college has a somewhat co-ed hostels. 

We had our fair share of fights, ranging from massive anger outburst from my side to dormant fights over a weekend. I won't say I am not happy around her, but there are a lot of disagreements and differences which has started making me think differently. I don't know about her, but from my perspective I too know that she is not exactly happy with me.

We started dating after a drunk makeout session one fine winter night, and then it went on. At first, it was nice, I had my share of alone time and things I could enjoy alone. But after a few months, once when we started sleeping together once or twice, she started demanding that I stay over everynight. Well, that's good, but she has grown a anxious attachment to me, even if for a small amount of time, I want to be left alone or go somwhere alone, she gets too anxious and starts getting angry as if I am leaving her. ( I understand that it is becuase of her ex, who cheated on her, and still made her feel bad about herself, made her the reason for him cheating). I have tried telling her and explaining it to her that I just need some alone time, some days off, some time to myself, bt she takes it in a negative way and makes me the villain, assumes that she is irritating me or she is being an obstruction in my life. I never meant it that way,  I being a single child have always grown up wih just my mom and dad, and always had a fair share of alone time and I enjoy it really. Even, when we are back from college on vacations, I talk to her on phone regularly, and even after a call of about 1 hours, when I say I need to go(yes, I am close to my parents a lot), she gets angry amd makes a fuss that I am leaving, or I don't want to talk to her. Even once when my mom came while talking to her, she just cut the call and later said she didn't want to disturb me, although I said my mom knows about you, and she just was calling me for lunch. She is not so close to her parents, and the problem is she never understands that I am close to mine, and I need/try to spend most of my home time with them, I sacrifice my sleep or comfort just to talk with her while standing in the basking sun on my terrace. 

While you guys might say, you should talk with her, but due to her less acceptance towards criticism, she had turned into a literal dodgebag right now. Whenever, I try to tell my problem or share that I feel this thing about you hurtful, she would strike back with, ""Yes, as if you never do this"" or "" Exactly, only you are the right person and everyone is wrong"". I don't know how to make her understand that something's are wron with her also, I am not saying that I am totally correct and I am grateful cause she showed me some of my big flaws and I have been trying to mend it. I just don't know, if just me apologizing for my mistakes and changing myself and adjusting me will work.

Last month, for some emergency, we had to come immediately from our college back, so there was a makeshift thought that we all will get carpooled by her dad(her dad is a heart patient so he doesn't drive much, driver will), her dad cried in front of her over call and said that my dad has forced him to drive all of us three back home, in his words ""I cannot bring you back home, how am I going to take responsibility of those other two boys(me and my friend)"", now the thing is  my dad didn't even ask him, becuase my dad doesn't even know that they have a car, it was the 2nd or 3rd time they were talking to each other. She blamed the whole thing on my dad, and said few insulting things to my dad too. I won't lie but in that heated argument I also said a bad thing about her dad, which she entrusted me with, and said never to use it in an argument.

Lastly, we have a lot of differences, like class, she belongs to higher middle class while I belong to a family whom has almsot 0 bank balance and is on education loan. Our idealogies are quite different in terms of lifelihood, in terms of money and in terms of societal beliefs. We belong from completely different households, where in mine, we prefer solving fights in ager so that every part of the injury comes out, while ber house beliefs in silent treatment. I am very close to my parents and we share everything with each other, while her family is the exact opposite, almsot nobody knows where another one is.

If anyone of you is here still, I really need some help, like what should I do next. I don't know if I really want to continue this relationship as our families will never match and neither can we both have a same mentality. Any one of us will always get butchered and have to adjust according to the other. But the thing is I am in this logn relationship for the first time, and it is very difficult for me to go over to that single phase again. Do you guys have any advice for this situation?


TL;Dr: Lots of differences, lots of adjustment, families will never accept due to very varied upbringing and family norms, had a lots of fight, some my mistake, some hers, but it is mostly me who is adjusting to her will and thoughts. Need help in what to do next, as I am not exactly happy in this relationship, but still can't break up from the first log relationship I had.",0,1kw4adj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kw4adj/need_advice_for_the_next_step/

"My (F28) fiance (M30) is upset I was upset yesterday and didn’t tell him why, today he is ignoring me even though it is my son’s birthday?","Yesterday was my son's 7th birthday. He was at his dad's place yesterday and I just got him here today. His dad was very emotionally abusive towards me and I couldn't even call to wish him a happy birthday. I was a bit sad yesterday.

But anyway, I don't know why I was feeling so down yesterday and even crying.

My fiance I have been with for tqo years said something (nothing mean) and I started crying, I felt very emotional yesterday. He came to me and asked me so many times what is wrong. I said I don't know I just feel a little bit down but it doesnt have something to do with you. He asked again and I said I don't know, he left the room after that and has been quiet/not talking all evening until he went to bed. He still cooked (his day) and asked me to eat and kissed my foreead goodbye innthe morning today. He also didn't even mention my son's birthday yesterday. He knows the date and the importance of it to me.

So today I did apologize to him for not speaking up about how I was feeling and being distant. I told him why I was sad, I apologized for not voicing it, explained why and told him it wasn’t fair to him. I see it was a pretty shitty move of me. I also got a babysitter for saturday for a concert he had been talking about so we could have some time. He said haha ok, and told me how much he suffers when he sees me unhappy.

Well after that he posted a tiktok video on his whatsapp status talking about when people don’t see your efforts, we were meant to celebrate my son today and I had gotten cake etc and waited for my fiance to sit with us after he had finished his shower after work. He just sat, ate his cake, starring into the table, and then went to the bedroom without a word and slept until way after my son went to bed around 9 PM. I went out bowling with my son alone after my fiance slept from 5 PM. 
 
Mind you we work the same hours, woke up the same time and I slept two hours later than him last night.

What can I do to make it better? I feel even more unhappy now and my stomach is paining from it all. Told him how it hurts but nothing since.

F27] My boyfriend [M28] is emotionally damaging me and I don’t know how to get out of it,"I’ve been in a relationship for a while and I honestly don’t know if what I’m experiencing is emotional abuse or if I’m just not strong enough. I’ve left and gone back so many times that I feel ashamed just saying that. But it’s affecting me so deeply that I had to write this out somewhere.

When we first got together, he was so loving. He told me I was everything. People around me said I’d hit the jackpot. I believed them. But slowly, things began to shift, and I didn’t even notice how much I was changing to survive being around him.

Here’s what I’ve been going through:
	•	He started criticizing how I talk, how I sit, how I look at him, how I even blink sometimes. He says I look “attacking” without saying anything. That my tone is disrespectful even when I’m just trying to explain.
	•	He constantly says I don’t have manners, that I’m not cultured, or that I don’t come from a good enough background. He even once gave me an old-fashioned etiquette book and suggested I “start from the basics” and stop wasting time on my interests.
	•	He makes me feel like I’m always failing. He doesn’t say it outright, but the way he acts, it’s like he truly believes I’m beneath him. It’s not even manipulative at this point—it feels like he’s just disgusted by who I am.
	•	He often says I can’t be a part of a “real family” like his. That I wouldn’t last in his home. That I was raised wrong and that’s why I behave the way I do. These aren’t heat-of-the-moment things. He says them like facts. And after a while, I’ve started believing it.
	•	If I bring up how I feel, he says I’m being too emotional, or that I’m playing the victim. If I say nothing, I’m giving attitude. If I ask a question, I’m challenging him. It’s like no matter what I do, I’m wrong.
	•	He blocks me whenever we argue. He shuts me out, disappears, and then waits for me to chase him, apologize, and fix it. And I always do. I can’t help myself. It’s like I’m addicted to proving to him that I’m not what he says I am.
	•	He’s extremely close to his mother, and I’ve always been made to feel like I’m competing with her. If I try to speak up about how I feel about that dynamic, I’m told I’m disrespecting his family. Meanwhile, I’ve felt guilty for even wanting time with my own parents.
	•	He’s never once apologized for anything, even when he’s been cruel. He once punched a mirror during a fight and said it was “because of me.” When I get upset, he mocks me or just tells me I need to calm down. I feel like my emotions are used against me every time.
	•	There have been times he’s gotten in my face, raised his voice, said things I still hear in my head days later. Things like how I need to learn my place, or that I shouldn’t speak unless I know how to. Even when I cry, he acts like I’m putting on a show.
	•	He’ll be loving again, and just when I think things are okay, he’ll find something small to fight about and say it’s over again. It’s like he breaks up with me every time I forget to keep my head down.
	•	I’ve tried to leave more times than I can count. I’ve lasted a few hours, maybe a day. Then I’m right back—texting him, apologizing, trying to calm him down. I hate that I do it. I feel pathetic. I feel like I’m addicted to him.

I’m scared that I’ll be stuck in this cycle forever. That I’ll never be able to leave for good. And I’m so mentally worn out. I’m an only child. I would never do anything to hurt myself, but this has affected me so much that I’ve had some really dark thoughts. I don’t even recognize myself anymore.

Please be kind. Please don’t judge me. I already feel so much shame. I just need to know—is this abuse? Or am I just not strong enough to handle a difficult relationship?

I feel like I’m disappearing.

TL;DR: My boyfriend is verbally and emotionally abusive. I keep going back to him even though I feel broken and scared, and I don’t know how to leave.

Feel like a terrible person,"Me (35F) and my boyfriend (30m) have been dating for alittle over a year. We have had our fair share of ups and downs. We recently broke up about 3 months ago bc he choose to spend all his time with his friends, couldn’t keep a job longer than a few months and pretty much made me feel like he never wanted to see me. Like choose everything and everyone over me. Well we got back together he promised things would change. They haven’t. Still no job. I haven’t seen him in 2 weeks. He lives 20 mins from me and isn’t busy but says he is. I’m so tired of asking hey when can I see you? Like he says he loves me and he text me all day everyday but I want more than that I want a real relationship with a future not a pen pal. I’m honestly not happy with how things are. A few days ago I had a guy I dated a few times a few years ago message me asking how I was and we’ve been messaging ever since. He honestly is everything I want in a guy and when we dated I ran away bc I wasn’t ready for what he wanted at the time but now I feel like we are on the same page. I feel like an absolutely terrible person for even talking to him while I’m in a relationship. He knows the situation and we’ve only talked. Of course he’s trying to persuade me his way bc he says he still cares about me always has and always will. He was able to recall everything I ever told him and every detail of every date we had. Definitely surprised me he cared that much to remember everything. But I do feel so guilty bc I do love my boyfriend but I know in my heart he’s never going to be able to be who I need him to be. He says he’s trying but never put anything into action. He’s constantly jumping from one thing to another. He changes his mind like he changes underwear and it makes me an absolute wreck. Because I like stability and consistency. I know what I need to do but I’m having such a hard time going through with it bc I do love him and I don’t want to hurt him but his empty promises are slowing tearing away at me.

"[M38] In a one year relationship that’s stable, but feels emotionally and physically disconnected…","I’m a 38-year-old man in a 12-month relationship with a woman (33F) who is kind, calm, and easy to be with. There’s no drama. On paper, it looks stable—no fighting, shared values, and a mutual desire to start a family. She came out of a 10-year relationship before this; I’ve had a few short to medium-term ones.

But emotionally and physically, I feel increasingly disconnected.

There’s very little passion. We barely kiss, sex is rare, and I hardly feel physical desire toward her anymore. In the beginning, we were more sexually active—but I was always the one initiating. Over time, I’ve lost interest. When we do have sex, it feels quiet, passive, and emotionless. No playfulness, no sounds, no intensity. So far this year, we’ve only had sex 5–6 times.

To clarify: my libido is fine. I feel sexual desire in general and find other people attractive. So I’m confident this isn’t a physical issue—it’s specific to *this* connection.

There’s also a lack of emotional depth. Our conversations mostly stay on the surface. She never asks how I’m feeling, and she rarely shares much about herself. There are no emotional check-ins, no real curiosity. I handle all the planning—meals, activities, social events. She goes along with things but almost never initiates. It feels like I’m carrying the energy for both of us.

One moment that really stuck with me:  
Halfway into the relationship, my pet (who meant the world to me) passed away. I was devastated. She was physically present, but emotionally absent—no questions, no comfort, just surface-level distraction. She never asked how I was doing or offered to help in any way. And I don’t think it came from cruelty—I think it’s emotional avoidance or fear of vulnerability.  
That moment made me realize how alone I actually felt, even in a relationship.

We had a conversation afterward (which I initiated) where I said clearly that I couldn’t be in a relationship without real communication or emotional openness. I told her it didn’t feel like we were where we should be after that amount of time. She was sad, but also receptive—and even suggested we start having weekly check-ins every Sunday. I agreed, thinking it was a great idea.

Fast forward a few months… and we haven’t had a single check-in.  
It’s clear: if I don’t initiate, nothing happens.

Now I’m torn.  
Part of me wants to try—to rebuild intimacy, passion, and connection. Maybe, with focus and mutual effort, something real could still grow.  
But another part of me wonders: if I have to work *this* hard just to feel something... maybe it’s just not there. Maybe it never really was.

Has anyone been in a relationship that felt more like habit than love?  
Were you able to turn it around—or did you realize it was better to let go?

TL;DR:  
In a stable, drama-free relationship with someone kind—but there’s no passion, emotional depth, or initiative. I do all the work, and I feel alone in the connection. Wondering if this can be rebuilt, or if I’m just holding onto something that isn’t truly love.",1,1kw1dba,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kw1dba/m38_in_a_one_year_relationship_thats_stable_but/
idk what’s next,"I am 21F with my boyfriend 23M. We’ve been together for almost 2 years now. 

When he came into my life I was very lost. I was mentally and physically in a bad place. I was barely eating, only partying, taking drugs to keep up with the lifestyle. The interest I felt towards him hit me like a truck. I was still heartbroken from my past relationship (cheater) and it scared me shitless. But I couldn’t stay away. 

I didn’t show him I cared. I pretended it was just about sex for me. I do flirt in a mean way, I like banter. He didn’t catch that and he let our sexual adventures go for someone else.  Having just come from a traumatizing breakup where I had been cheated on, this only added fuel to the fire. 

He woke me up and I decided to get clean. Eat more. Take care of myself. He inspired me to care about anything at all. And then we got into a relationship at last. It started out rocky. He was insecure, I was horribly scarred and jealous. But with time he has become an amazing sweet gentle loving partner and so have I.

But now I do see that I crave something more passionate again. I have found peace within again and have healed from my past trauma, in part thanks to him. He however is still deeply insecure.  He doesn’t take the lead, but in his defense he never did. 

And I now feel mad at him for that sometimes. Because now that I’ve healed I want more push back. More challenge. I feel like a bad person because he has been so kind to me. We’ve talked about breaking up a lot, about how we would always love each other as friends.

 I just don’t know how to go about these things. When do you let go? How? Is it ever a good time? This is my first love. Is it stupid to let it go to waste because of some horny bad boy fantasy? If I do and chase adventure will I fall back into my toxic patterns?  Being 21 and not knowing anything is so hard man… 

TL;DR!: I’m not sure if our story ends here and I should let him go or if I’m being blinded by what I don’t have :(",0,1kw0kv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kw0kv6/idk_whats_next/
I (30M) think that my best friend (23NB) has been lovebombing me. How do I broach this with them?,"I (30M) became really close with my best friend (23NB) towards the tail end of last year. Before then we were in each other's orbits and fairly close but since we started working together we became pretty inseperable. This surprised me to be honest. Obviously there's quite an age gap, but we work in hospitality where this isn't uncommon. You kind of make friends with everyone, we just happened to get really really close.

It was quite intense to be honest. We had deep conversations, they would send me videos about how cool it was for them to finally have someone they could call their best friend (something we bonded over early, as we're both neurodivergent and struggle to connect with people). They sent me poetry they wrote about how much our friendship meant to them. They said they'd ask me to be their best man when they get married to their girlfriend, and I extended them the same offer. It felt so good to be able to just express how much they meant to me, and to have them respond in kind. It felt *nice* to finally have someone that cared so openly.

In the last 2 months, something has shifted however, and it's making me think I'm going fucking crazy. They stopped sending me stupid little videos, saying that they were trying to focus on not doomscrolling as much. Ok, sure, that's reasonable. Then they asked me to stop asking them how their day was going, because it made them feel pressured to perform (whatever that means). But fine, I'm a good friend, I'll acquiesce and do whatever it takes to help them be comfortable. Now I'm lucky to hear from them at all. My Instagram used to get about 120 notifications a day, mostly from them. Now, I get 6. Every time I try to organize time to hang out, they are busy or have something else to do or are too fatigued. Today, we closed together, and they didn't say a single word to me aside from the odd comment about the close. When we closed together two months ago, we would accidentally stay 30 minutes over, off the clock. Now it feels like they can't wait to get away from me.

I've brought this up a couple of times with them. They always seem to have something to say about it. ""I promise we're fine, I just go people blind when I don't see them"", or ""I promise we're fine, I just have a lot going on. Don't ask me about it, it stresses me out."" or ""I promise we're fine, I just don't want to be on my phone anymore"". I feel like it's gotten to the point where if I talk to them again about this, it'll break the friendship in half. Every time I work with them, or see them, I leave the encounter feeling like utter shit. Angry at myself and like I'm not worth anything to them anymore.

I've spoken to my other friends about how they've made me feel and they've noticed no difference in the way they communicate with me. They said they're probably just stressed or something, but nothing is wrong. It's making me feel like I'm insane, like something has changed but if nobody else has noticed it, am I going crazy?

I feel like I need to discuss this with them but I can't just do it while we're on shift together, and I *definitely* don't want to do it over the phone. I want to preserve the friendship, more than anything because I don't want my other friends to have to pick sides in case shit goes nuclear, and because I still have to work with them. This isn't like a romantic relationship, my entire social life could be ruined if I don't handle this with grace.

It should also be said, that comes August, they'll be moving away. Worst case scenario, I can just ride it out til they go and I never have to see them again, but this person is such an important part of my life that I don't want to let them go. I do, sincerely, care about them. Like I would forgive them for all of it if I could just make them see how this has affected me and there was some kind of actionable change.

Have I been lovebombed? Or am I overreacting? How do I navigate this topic? How can I speak to them about this in a way where they'll actually hear me, and not handwave what I'm saying as a general desire for reassurance? Is this even salvageable, or should I just resign myself to the fact that every time I look at them for the next two months, I'll feel like a worthless piece of garbage and hope that when they leave I won't be *too* devastated, just letting the bridge fall apart on its own?

tl;dr: At the start of our friendship, my best friend would be very open and frank with displays of affection, and has pulled all of that back with no warning. I feel dejected and upset. Have I been lovebombed, and if so how can I bring this up to them in a way that preserves the friendship?",0,1kw0imz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kw0imz/i_30m_think_that_my_best_friend_23nb_has_been/
My(22F)best friend(23F)won’t give back my ex’s(25M)clothes and it’s starting to upset me,"I (22F) had my best friend (23F) sleep over a couple weeks ago. The next morning, I gave her some clothes to wear as she didn’t have new ones, it was just random stuff I had lying around, including a pair of sweatpants and a t-shirt that used to belong to my ex. We’ve joked before about how I still have a bunch of his stuff (he lived with me for a while, so yeah, some things stuck around).

About a week later, I asked if she could return them. She said she would wash them first, which was fine. But now it’s been another week and she told me she’s not going to give them back. I was honestly confused and asked why. She said it’s for my own good, implying that keeping his stuff around isn’t healthy.

I get the intention. A few months ago, she threw out a pair of his old slippers I had. At the time, I was in a good place and didn’t really care, so I let it go. But this time feels different. I didn’t ask her to get rid of anything, just to return it, and it’s starting to annoy me. I feel disrespected, even if she thinks she’s helping.

How should I handle this without blowing things out of proportion? I don’t want to fight, but I also don’t want to let my boundaries slide.

TL;DR:
I lent my best friend my ex’s clothes to wear, asked for them back, and now she refuses to return them “for my own good.” I understand her reasoning but it’s upsetting me.

I M20 am going insane with my gf F19 and I don’t know how I should feel.,"Ok so my gf and I have been dating for roughly 8 months now, and I can’t tell whether I’m overthinking things too much, if I’m valid, or just completely insane. I’d say my main issue is I don’t really feel loved she doesn’t hug me really ever, barley kisses me, and never is really the one to say I love you without me saying it first. 

There was even one time we got into somewhat of an argument because she pulled her hand away from me when I was trying to hold it. I try and look over these I really do because it shouldn’t impact how strong our love is but after time it just doesn’t feel reassuring at all. I struggle with it a lot and sometimes even feel like shit for wanting all this but I really don’t think it’s too much to ask for. 

I’m not done though. I would say my biggest issue of all is TikTok she is on it all the time and when I try to express how I feel she brushes it off. When we started dating she had just got out of a long relationship and I do believe she is done with her ex but yet she constantly is reposting things too about how happy she is she isn’t with her ex… maybe I’m wrong but that isn’t you being over it that’s you letting him live rent free. This whole thing has been driving me mad I try to focus on myself but every time I think hard about it I just want to break down.

The worst thing about it too is how I handle it, I’m not great at conveying my feelings and just go silent. She always turns this around on me and claims that I’m mad at her when really I just want to start balling my eyes out. When she asks if I’m ok all I can muster out is I’m fine when it’s the farthest from the truth. I think now all she sees me as is just some guy who gets mad at her for no reason and I don’t want to bring up my issues to again reassure her that all I do is make problems.

She still tells me she loves me but for some reason I struggle to believe it. I feel as though she doesn’t see me as her boyfriend but as her Boy Friend who she can love when she chooses. I feel so small typing this out on reddit but I have no where else to vent so here I am. If you’ve made it this far thank you for reading and have a good day.  

TL;DR: I don’t feel loved from my girlfriend and don’t know if I’m overthinking it or not accepting a truth.",0,1kvxxbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvxxbc/i_m20_am_going_insane_with_my_gf_f19_and_i_dont/
"Should I (F17) try to improve things with my boyfriend (M17) or not, context:","ok, so basically my bf and I have been dating for like 5 months, and over the last week I've been thinking if I really want to be in a relationship. We are both 17, but he dropped out of school and is working, and I'm still in school and am very, very busy with extracurriculars and studying in my last year of high school. So we see each other usually once or twice every week or 2, but we mainly communicate through snap videos, just so it's like a facetime, but whenever either of us are free, we can just open it and respond. But lately I've been a really bad girlfriend and not responded for a couple of days at a time, and I kind of blamed it on me being so busy because I have been in a musical that's gone on over the past month or so and which we only closed the other day. 

Anyways, to get to the point, idk if it's because of my raging adhd and the fact that I keep seeing the timer for how long he's been on delivered for as a deadline, but I'm the kind of person who physically and mentally shuts down when I'm stressed and I don't want to talk to anyone. 

He's my first boyfriend, and I've had crushes before him, but the way we were talking before he asked me out was in a very friend-like kind of way, and I wouldn't say I had a crush on him when we started dating. We were just talking for so long (like months) that i kind of felt the pressure to date him (not to say i entirely didn't want to, i liked him to a point and had fun talking to him so i assumed that's what the relationship would kind of look like and since he's my first boyfriend i kind of had no clue on how a relationship works.)

We have a couple of things in common, and he's attractive and funny, and I obviously like him, but he keeps going on about going on trips away or how he's going to drive to see me when I move to uni next year, and i have big goals and ambitions, where I want to go places and pursue different things and hobbies and enjoy experiencing life, but he is more close minded with the fact of moving on to bigger things (I think mostly because he's already got a stable job and everything). He also brought up the idea of sex when I was drunk and he was driving me home, but I didn't really respond because I was uncomfy and one thing that really kind of freaked me out was that he told my friend (when he was drunk so take it with a grain of salt) that he's ""in this for marriage"". Like he's moving too fast for me, and I think it's selfish of me if I can't give him the attention and time he deserves. He's a really lovely person and I do enjoy spending time with him it's just that I don't think our relationship is sustainable in the way he probably thinks it is.

The catalyst for me beginning to think this way was recently when we were together he was telling me about how much he thinks about me, especially when we are seeing each other that day and how excited he gets, which I said the same for me, because no confrontation means everyone is happy right. But I began to feel really bad about not feeling the same way and I know I don't put as much effort into the relationship as him and he really is trying, but I just feel like I'm being toxic and selfish in not communicating these things but at the same time i literally cannot.

Some other things;

\- sometimes he gets a bit to touchy or wants physical affection and that's fine and this is entirely my fault for not saying anything, but i hate confrontation more than anything in the entire world, and i can tell he gets a bit off when he hints at a kiss and i don't give one. I am just not a big physical person

\- whenever I'm alone with him, i still feel a little uncomfy and not entirely comfortable with him as i feel like i should be in an almost 6 month relationship

\- everyone says we are such a cute couple and that we are perfect together, so if i was to end things with him out of the blue many people would talk (small town ya know)

\- my best friend's boyfriend is one of his best friends, so that would be a tad awkward 

\- i feel like i should just thug it out and see what happens, but i also think we just aren't as close as we should or could be.

\- this might've just been all because of stress and not communicating...



TL;DR:

\- I've been dating my boyfriend for 5 months, but lately I've been questioning if I actually want to be in this relationship. 

\- We're both 17,  he's out of school and working, and I'm in my final year with a packed schedule. We barely see each other and mostly talk over Snapchat.

\- I’ve been distant lately, partly due to stress, adhd, and just shutting down under pressure.-

\- He’s sweet and tries hard, but I feel like he’s more emotionally invested, talking about the future, marriage, and sex, while I still don’t feel fully comfortable with him. I never had strong romantic feelings from the start (we just kind of slid into dating.)

\- I hate confrontation, so I haven’t told him any of this, but deep down I feel we might not be compatible long-term.",1,1kvwfcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvwfcu/should_i_f17_try_to_improve_things_with_my/
Boyfriend plays games when I need him the most,"I (23F) has been super stressed out the past few weeks as my sister (also my bestfriend) has been diagnosed with cancer. Found out today that my sister's cancer diagnosis is a lot worse than what we thought. When I was still in the room talking to the doctor, I texted my boyfriend (24M) telling him my sister's 2 years life expectancy. Well, he did reply though telling me that I needed to stay strong, and that's about it.

When I came out of the doctor's room, the first thing I really wanted to do is to cry out, talk, and call my boyfriend, and that is when I found out that he had started a game with his friends and couldn't talk to me for the until 2 hours later.

My boyfriend told me that had I told him to stop playing his games to call and talk to me, he would have. Although I can't help but to feel disappointed as I had expected him to offer me emotional support without me needing to ask. Not only did he not offer, he proceeded to occupy himself with games.

He has always been a gamer, but he didn't game as much when he first met me and has only gotten back into gaming when the honeymoon period died down. We have been dating for slightly over a year now. 

Idk, I am so heartbroken right now by what had just happened. This is the third time I am so disappointed as I had not received any emotional support from him during this entire time when my sister had to undergo surgery which heavily impacted my mental health too. I'm not sure if I'm overly emotional and irrational right now due to the series of events that have happened, but I really feel like giving up on this relationship. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.

Tldr; my boyfriend (24M) was busy playing games when I (23F) needed emotional support as my sister has been diagnosed with cancer. I feel like giving up on this relationship.",60,1kvuk0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvuk0r/boyfriend_plays_games_when_i_need_him_the_most/
"How do i fix our relationship? (15M, 15F)","Me and my boyfriend of around 4ish months have been struggling this past week. We started dating this past February. And it’s been awesome. I’ve known him for three years.  We’ve only had one major fight that was in April, over a month ago, and we almost broke up over it. But we made up and things have been going great since then.

Until this past week. My boyfriend (15M) has been acting very distant recently. He’s been busy a lot and every he’s not busy and talking to me, i feel a lack of effort or care. I know we’re both 15, but I want to make this work. I don’t feel like he will break up with me, but whenever we try to talk out our feelings, I feel he shuts down completely and becomes defensiv.

we got into a stupid miscommunication last morning. I called him and he sounded very disinterested in me. I want to bring it up to him. But I’m not sure how. I haven’t even seen him in a week. I dont know what to do.

its taking a huge toll on my mental health too. Yesterday I blacked out, and when I woke up my heart was pounding and I was shaking very badly.

im trying to keep a positive mind, but my overthinking might be sabotaging me. And maybe our relationship.

Is there any way I can try and bring this issue up? We’ve only been having problems this past week. And it hasn’t been too bad until the past 3 days. He still says he loves me and I believe him. But what can I do to make this better? I love him so much and I want it to work out.

im personally a Christian, so I’ve been praying tons about this. If anyone else is religious, could you please pray for me as well? It would help lots. I need advice, but i really don’t want the “just break up with him” comments, please none of those. He’s a good guy, and very sweet, I just don’t know what’s up with h8m recently. Should I ask if he’s okay?

(btw, the issues kinda started on  the friday before last Friday. But it hasn’t been that bad. It’s only been bad around Saturday/sunday. He was with his friend, Zane, that I USED to date for around a month in 7th grade. I’m going to be a sophomore this next school year. I dont know if that has something to do with it or not, but theres a possibility he might’ve said something to him. I’m not sure. If anyone sees this, please give advice. I’m a teenager desperate for help.

  
so uh… update, we did break up. But I think it’s for the better. Thanks for the advice guys. But I’m doing okay, I know it’s for the better

My relationship feels more platonic than romantic,"I (22F) and my partner (22M) have been together for 4 years, we recently had our first baby together 4 months ago and are loving being parents. Before I got pregnant my partner and I already weren’t very intimate, so much so that when we conceived our son it was our first time being intimate in 7 months and that was the last time we were intimate. I find myself initiating intimacy (kissing, cuddling, sexual favours) plenty of times a week and am constantly denied and sometimes even told to stop being weird. I love my partner and we are really good friends within our relationship, we laugh and talk all the time. I’ve spoken to my partner about what I want and how I feel and he’s assured me that he loves me and cares for me but he just isn’t in the mood and shouldn’t have to give a reason why. I don’t know what to do, should I continue to go without sexual intimacy for months on end for the rest of my life not only for my relationships sake but now my sons as well? Is there really anything else that can be done? My partner is extremely hardheaded and stubborn and won’t really listen to me. I Really feel stuck. I love him but I feel like we need to be more intimate than we are. 

TL;DR - my relationship feels more platonic than romantic but we have a great relationship and I love him so much. Should I just deal with this for my son’s sake? ",3,1kvsep3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvsep3/my_relationship_feels_more_platonic_than_romantic/
My boyfriend is losing his love for me,"Hello, I am sorry if I make mistakes as english is not my first language and I am currently holed up in my work office, crying.

Yesterday, my bf of two years dropped a bomb on me: he feels like he was not so ready for a committed relationship (he is 25M and barely experienced life like different partners, travel, diff jobs etc) when I'm 28F and I have traveled for 8 years and had quite a few relationships, situationships, you name it.

We both know that what we have is rare and great but lately, Bf has been slipping into a more depressive state due to work and responsibilities. When I met him, he was doing season work and living at his parents, and I took him traveling, and we moved together into an apartment in another city. This adulting was quite new for him and I knew back then that eventually he would feel like it was a lot or he was missing out on his twenties. However, he always assured me that he loved me more than anything and would follow me anywhere.

Side note: he struggles with depressive episodes and is very lost in life. I am trying to be supportive but sometimes it is a lot and he refuses therapy.

The last couple weeks, he has been distant with me. He usually takes care incredible care of me and is very onto me, and I am the one more independent. His new job got him new friends, which Im so happy about and smh I felt like our lives were more balanced (we live in my hometown so I have a lot of friends and family around but he did not). I went for a weekend trip with friends that he knows very well but he could not come due to work on saturday. I let him know about my endeavours as usual, and he went out with his work friends. During the evening, I felt weird - his messages were scarce which is not like him at all. I felt insecure for the first time in almost two years, but I buried the feeling and said nothing, because there was no rational reason to freak out.

Now two weeks later, we just had amazing sex that I initiated ( I know I recently got lazy on that part too so trying to make an effort) and he says:

\-I am feeling trapped, and I am uneasy when thinking that I will never flirt, never get to know anyone else

\-I feel like roomates lately and our routine is too much to handle, I feel flat

\-and finally, he says that he has a crush on a work colleague and that he's been distant because he feels shitty towards me.

NB: he is very loyal and respectful, so he did not act on it. Just feeling that crush already drove him crazy.

So I told him that if our life was too serious, we could kick it and do something else - I KNEW his age when getting with him and his background, and I always told him I was ok doing something else. But he struggles to tell me what he wants, he only talks about what he does not want and I don't want him resenting me because I always decide so I am waiting on him deciding something. (I am happy with my life now though).

I told him that indeed, we had a routine of flatmates. We need to go on more dates, do couple activities, not just hang at the flat or with friends and that I was absolutely willing to start doing that

And for the crush, even though it hurt bad, I admitted that I had some crushes too. The thing is, it's easy to crush on the next new thing. Usually its sparkles in your eyes and then something makes you understand they're not compatible with you. My little crushes would always go away in a couple weeks naturally, because what I have with bf is so much bigger, stronger, more beautiful and I love him so much. Being slightly attracted to someone else cannot shake that for me.

He was surprised by my revelation and took it in for a while, understanding where I was coming from. He offered to change jobs to get distance with her to which I said, if you like your job, don't do.

We then spent the entire evening crying, consoling each other. He would say things like 'if we separate for a little while, then we will find each other better'. He misses missing me and I understand that. We also talked about how when he goes out, he feels the need to come home to me early and feels frusrtated. And I was actually mad at this one because we are party people and I never put pressure on him in that regard. He says he does not want me to be alone home but I said im fine with me-time (im a geek too so i usually use the time to play). I feel like he puts a lot of unrealistic expectations on himself, he has this idealistic idea of love and what a couple is so for him getting a crush was shattering. I am from a different background so I am more open to listening and understanding that this things happen, you can't control it but what defines you is how you act on it.

I have barely slept and I'm sick, trying to give him some space this day but even through the few messages we sent, I can feel he is distancing himself lots.

We decided for now to keep going on and reflect on a solution or things to put in place in the upcoming months and reconvene this conversation next weekend. We don't want to rush and yesterday was madly emotional. But I don't know what to do: give him space, accept the break? I feel too anxious and rejected to be initiating much but maybe I should push myself? I am so very lost and every thing he does that is not his usual caring self hurts me deep. He was crying so much yesterday, saying he felt like an asshole and that he loved me still and would see a future with me but that he felt like it was all a lot now (which he never mentioned before). Anyway I will stop rambling, sorry for the extensive post and thank you to anyone who will take the time to read

"How can i help my bf (m29) to be better at not getting stressed and frustrated, that leds to him putting it on me (f28) ?","Hey, i hope i frased that question correct!

We have been together for 6 months. Talking about future etc. Everything is great, execpt for this little part. FYI. We have cultural differences. He is british i am Latvian/Russian/Danish ( fun mix ) .

He have shoulder and knee problems, that do give him some pain through the day, He is though very active 8-10 hous a day. And do his rehab when he can. This just kind of adds to the fire.

When something happens, f.eks he needs to do tax return, his cars breaks sounds weird, his bank needs some papers etc. Basicly everything admin is stressing him out. There is other things too, but you get the point.

The problem is, its always me that gets the snappy side of him. When he is stressed or frustrated, he snaps at me. He is not mean or yells, mostly just gets annoyed with me really fast and snaps, especally with my english, as its far from my native language. But coming from violent home, it does make me scared, cause i do not see it coming nor i am deserving of this. He knows he have this problem, cause other ex's have been saying the same. Like he says, he knows its wong but i am just there and he cant stop him self. And i am also well aware i am very emotional and easy to tears, that dont make this easy.

I do understand life can be hard and i try to be very patien and try not react, but after 3 days of constant snapping, you just cant hold the tears back. I am opposite of that, if i am stressed, you cant feel it on me, cause my problems is nobody elses problem.

How do i make him want to not be snappy with me. What to say to give him the right tools to learn to handle his stress. Is there anything to do? 

Sorry for my bad english. :D

TL;DR: Frustrated that i do not know how to make him see that he needs to be more aware of his stress managment.

l [F34] not sure where I stand with this relationship !,"am [F34] . I have been in a relationship for almost two years with my Boyfriend [M37] . We both met in a polyamorous setup . I have a kid of 6 years and I was not particularly looking for a relationship when I met him . He was living with his partner (ex) [F31] and they have been togtehr for more than 12 years . And when  me and boyfriend met . In a couple of months we started doing more stuff together . Like he started doing a lot of activities together and we both visited each other and I introduced him to my son after 6 months of being in the relationship . I as well noticed that me and him both are not happy in a polyamorous relationship and it causes a lot of friction between us . I told him end of October (after a lot of self assessment and reflection for few months with my therapist etc) that I want to be monogomous . He said he wil need some time and after couple of months in January he broke up with his long term partner that now his ex that he still lives with .

And after the break up they continued doing everything togtehr like dance classes ( they started dance classes because I asked him to take up a dance classes with me he said she has been asking it for a long time so I had to wait until they started it until I started dancing with him when they both were stil togtehr ) And they shared they same bed room . This all got to me and I told him this is all very tough on me . And I told him he cancelling plans with me to show up for her .

And because I told him I needed space in February to think about the situation . He broke up with me as I was taking this space to think about the situation .  ( and ever since then I am not allowed to visit him in his home and after a long fight he role me I can visit when she is not there , that’s may be once per week in the day and may be once a year or so when she is travelling )

And we got back together immediately after a week . We both are driven in the relationship by the fear of him spending time with her when we take a break or when we stay away and do our things and he is afraid to share things that he does with her or share because he is afraid of her reaction .

They still live in the same home . I do believe that the dynamic between them has changed and I do believe that they can be good friends . I think they both are codependent on each other .

And I am not in a mental place to live with anyone or i also denied that I idea that he brought up about moving in with me .  We both go to couples therapy (on my request ) to get out of this toxic cycle of fighting with each other . And screaming at each other .

The moment I start to regulate myself alone and take space form him . He does things with her like going out for lunch etc ,.

I do not know how much energy do I have to give him the space to process his breakup with his ex and move out of the home ( that he denies doing ) and he stil goes for dance class with her and then after the dance class they go out for dinner like a routine every week ..

I feel miserable not being able to manage or regulate myself to manage this . I do know that I know better than sitting at my home hoping that he comes back to me and be fair to me in the relatsionhip .

On the other hand it hurts that he doesn’t open up and discuss why it’s important for him to do all of this . The more I am in this relatsionhip my self worth feels like is going down .

I do love him .i am not sure if anybody can come out of this transition phase stronger together . I am losing hope sometimes . Any advice would be appreciated .

TL;dr

Transitioned from poly to mono with my partner [M37] . And he stil lives with his ex and goes dancing and plans stuff and goes out for lunch etc ,. I feel lost I do not know where I stand . Can these transitions really work ? ",2,1kvrg71,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvrg71/l_f34_not_sure_where_i_stand_with_this/
Is it toxic of me (20 M) to feel bad because my partner (23 M) thinks about his very old relationship when he’s with me?,"We've known each other for 6 months. I’ve suspected this for a long time, because we often listen to music together, and I always found it curious that almost all the songs he likes are about heartbreak or failed relationships. A few weeks ago, while we were listening to a new album by his favorite band, he burst into tears during one song that was exactly about that and it removed all doubt, since he’s someone who practically never cries. Since I’ve known him, I’ve only seen him cry once, and it was in a moment of extreme emotional vulnerability. The fact that he cried because he felt so connected to the song made me realize what that relationship meant to him.

Since the album came out, in which every song deals with those themes, I’ve seen him listen to it every day even when he’s with me. He once told me that he listens to it 24 hours a day, especially one song the very one I saw him cry to and I still see him listening to it all the time.

The truth is, I have to admit it makes me feel really bad. As if I were a replacement for him; as if that relationship was the love of his life while I’m just what he has to settle for. That he’ll never love me as much as he loved that person; that maybe, if only I were that person, he’d treat me with more affection, show more interest in me, and I wouldn’t have to be constantly begging for his attention or always be the one putting in all the effort. I know I sound like an exaggerator when I say all this, but it’s impossible not to think about it when he keeps feeling so bad about a relationship from six years ago, even though he’s with me.

I don’t know anymore maybe it’s just my immaturity. :’/

I (22F) am not inlove with my my husband (M23) anymore. I don’t know what to do,"Me and my husband have been married for almost 4 years now. He’s a narcissist, he has been physically, sexually (depriving to gain power and validation) emotionally and financially abusive a majority of our marriage. I’ve made posts regarding the details previously, I am and have been extremely unhappy in my marriage from the beginning. Well..I made a leap, and I decided to leave him a couple months ago. We live in Alaska, and I moved to Oregon for a few months. Well, he visited me in Oregon and begged to see me. I did, and I was surprised at the man he was. After he left, we started texting again. Eventually it turned into him agreeing to do therapy, promising to be better to me and better himself. He made some huge promises..saying he’ll never lay hands on me, and that he’ll be less hostile and more affectionate, not abandon me so often (he works on his fishing boat an hour away from home, he decides his own hours and often wakes up at 7am and comes home at 2am..other than that, he fishes all the time and rarely texts or calls me) and that he’ll continue doing therapy and that whatever I have issues with in his behavior-I could communicate them and he’ll work on it with the help of therapy..

So I came back…

No, he has not harmed me. Yes, he is really trying to be more affectionate and soft and romantic, yes he’s trying to hear my feelings out most of the time…but he’s still really mean at times randomly, he’s still super critical of me, he said that he has a huge problem with me communicating what I need him to change and work on in therapy, and at first he came home earlier as promised…but now he’s just back to working long long hours, leaving me abandoned again. He was listening to my problems at first but now he’s started saying “could you just sum up your feelings in 1 word” and when I explain that my feelings are more complex than just 1 word, he gets angry at me. He falls asleep when I’m crying next to him. He doesn’t ever wanna have sex once again, and it leaves me deprived even when I communicate my need for more intimacy. When he’s home, he acts like a dead fish and isn’t as affectionate like ever. I feel like everything is going back to the way it once was. When I tell him this, he calls me and makes me feel like I’m crazy. And I came back very hesitantly anyway, and now I just feel like his actions are chipping away more and more at my already broken heart. I’m laying here all alone, deprived of love, just unsure of what to do. I’m in a religion where divorce is VERY looked down upon…so if I divorce him, my friends and family will literally disown me. Theyll stop associating with me, stop talking to me. It’s such a scary leap, one of the big reason I even came back. 

Now confession time. 

Everything I said above is completely true word for word, and it’s been existing problems since the beginning of my marriage. I am not biased, I see what’s happening completely clearly..

But I started having strong feelings for another man. Let’s call him “T”. I always deny them in my own head, because I know it’s insane and I’m really trying to make this work with my husband. But T is a good friend of mine, he helped me make the leap to leave my husband..saying that I don’t deserve any of it. When I came out there and wasn’t with my husband, he cheered me up and showed me softness. He made me feel so beautiful and cherished and like I was golden. We talked often, we had lots in common. We laughed ugly laughs together and had so many inside jokes. He showed me maturity…when I hinted i was going through lady issues and wasn’t feeling well, he flat out addressed my period as something not to be ashamed of..he even brought me food and a milkshake and danced to music in his vehicle with me. My husband is very disgusted even thinking about the fact I have a period, so this was shocking behavior for me to experience from another man. It’s like my sickness went away. We kissed, and he didn’t act disgusted like my husband always does. He made me feel sooo precious again. Absolutely warmed my heart. He talked about leaving the religion with me, and how he loves kids and would love to raise mine with him. He was just so sweet and he made me feel so good. I wanted to runaway with him, but I became too afraid. I told him everything I was going through every step of the way with my husband, he even tried giving me advice on how to make it work with him, poor thing. I know he really wanted us to be together. When I came back to my husband, I just never got anything close to that softness. All of that was ripped away due to my decision to avoid a bad reputation and try and make it work with him. 

Me and T still text, but now there are so many boundaries since I’m participating in my marriage again. I know T really likes me too, and it’s this weird wall between me him and my husband. I feel heartbroken not to have T’s affection. I daydream about my heart feeling so warm again. I feel so awful for these emotions that I have because I’ve always been so deathly loyal to my husband…but I just feel like I’m not in love anymore. I’m really trying to fall back in love, but it’s like a bouncy ball thrown at a wall, it just flies back away.

Has anyone ever experienced a toxic relationship where you fell out of love, but were able to fall back in love? If so, how did you do it? I feel like my scars are already so deep from my marriage and they’re being cut back open before healing. What do I do? I feel so jumbled. I just want to run away. I hate my life with my husband. He’s a jerk and he works me too hard with no appreciation. I am losing my literal mind while feeling absolutely shackled. 



TL;DR: I fell out of love with my husband and am looking to find ways to fall back in love, but I have feelings for another man at the same time. What do I do?",0,1kvq6h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvq6h3/i_22f_am_not_inlove_with_my_my_husband_m23/
Is it possible to save this relationship?,"I’ll try to keep it as short as possible. We were together (23F and 26M) for 5 years, with many ups and downs, but exactly a month ago we broke up. I was the one who dumped him because I got emotionally drained of our fights, mainly the problem was his jealousy that isolated me from friends and the life I once lived. 

During the breakup he said that we can move past it, we can fix it and that he feels different about those things now. I just didn’t understand how he feels different about those things because he never sat down and talked to me about it during the relationship, apologized or took accountability. I was very crushed by that and said I wasn’t breaking up because of not having feelings anymore, but because I can’t trust that he will be different. 

After that he hit me up once again that he wants to talk and “ask me some questions”, and I panicked and said I will talk to him when I’m ready because I’m still vulnerable and he agreed to it. 


My guilt grows over time for not giving him a second chance but I really thought that it was over. I admit that I was wrong because it clearly is not over for me, and I failed in my judgement. I’m fucking stupid but I want to do what’s right. If it means we are for each other I will fight for it. 

Please if anyone got back together after the breakup with their partner, please do share your experience.

TLDR: Broke up with my bf of 5 years due to his jealousy and lack of accountability. During the breakup he said he wants to fix things and I regret not giving him a second chance. Thought it was over but I was mistaken. ",3,1kvq08j,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvq08j/is_it_possible_to_save_this_relationship/
Me (23f) and my taken best friend (24m) had a romantic day and I feel awful,"I am so sorry for the long post, but bear with me and give me your opinion on the topic.

Me and my best friend know each other for around 8 years and since the day we met, we became so close as if we knew each other for years.

Over the years we had moments where we became romantically close, but nothing happened. The first time I pulled, because I was scared that I will break our friendship and I, unfortunately, started a cycle of push and pull from both sides.

Two years ago I moved to a different city for college and this week he came to see me. We haven’t seen each other in a year, at least not in person but we were talking or texting every day. And.. things became romantic the moment we went out. He started hugging me, holding my hand and, to be fair, I forgot that he never told me that something happened between him and his girlfriend.

We were never touchy, we always walked side by side, but this time it was completely different. We went to a restaurant, when I was in the bathroom he paid the bill, he was feeding me and was even jealous from the server but I thought he broke up with her. Because I didn’t think that he would behave like that if he was in a relationship..

I saw a photo posted from his girlfriend, they are still together. I wanna talk about this with him, but he doesn’t want to. I tried to ask him what he wants but he always takes it as a joke even tho I tell him that I want to talk seriously. I tried everything, he denies talking to me about this. I even went to his city for our friends birthday, I drove 5 hours just to see my closest people for a little and he didn’t show up. I think he ghosted his best friend because I was there. I was so upset, I wanted to talk in person because I thought that maybe he will tell me why. I didn’t think that he will start to ignore me, he leaves me on read now.

And it breaks my heart because, in a way, I feel used, his girlfriend doesn’t know he came to see me, he lied to her and our friends that he didn’t see me so I lied with him and I feel awful. And yes, I understand that I started this push and pull thing, but we were kids. And I really feel scared to push the topic even more but it’s eating me inside that in a way I am secret.

I know his girlfriend, I have been to her house many times and I feel bad. Even tho we know for a fact that they are not for each other. She is mean to him, calls him different names all the time when all I see in him is a kind and loving person. He was always there when I needed someone to listen to me or help me and I was there for him when he needed me. He was never the type to talk a lot, so I feel sad that she makes him more insecure than happy and open.

He calls me “his wife” and stuff for years, but things never got this real until this moment.

I have always liked him, but thought that he sees me as a friend and never persuaded. And in a way I wish that we didn’t see each other. I had couple of boyfriends over the years but in the end I was always comparing them to him. And he always won. And i don’t wanna regret not talking this in the future, but maybe he regrets the moment with me and it’s easier for him to ghost me.

Please give me some kind of advice, should I try talking to him again or should I ignore him until he wants to talk? And how can I be just friends with him now, I am so confused. He messed with my head really bad and left.

TL;DR my best friend is taken but came to see me and spent with me a romantic day. Lied to everyone that we didn’t see each other and I though that he was single by the way he was behaving. Now he doesn’t wanna talk to me at all and ignores me.",0,1kvpxw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvpxw0/me_23f_and_my_taken_best_friend_24m_had_a/
My (24f) GF (23f) dominates conversations,"We’ve been dating only for 3 1/2 months and I want to spend as much time with her as possible. She is sweet, loving, and kind and seemingly perfect in all regards except in some conversations. 

For example, when I want to talk to her about something I find really important she doesn’t respond to what I say but rather goes on to talk about a related story or idea. She doesn’t ask questions about what I say, either. Like if I say something like, “Yeah I totally get it my day was kind of bad as well” she won’t really inquire about it or acknowledge it she just keeps on talking about her day. Also, She never rants about beliefs or things she likes, it’s all memories or stories about her childhood. Today is my birthday, and she called me and wished me happy birthday and proceeded to talk about how her birthdays in her 20s have been. It’s confusing, because she had just sent me a long text talking about the present moment and how she is grateful I’m in her life. 

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind having conversations not be about me (I work with the elderly so that’s my daily work life, lol)! I’m just confused how her actions (she spends so much time making sure i’m happy) and her written words feel so real and focused, but her conversational patterns and what i know she’s trying to express just do not make sense. 

We talked about this once before; I asked her why she does that and emphasized I don’t think it’s bad, I just don’t fully understand it. She says it’s her way of relating to me, but I feel uncomfortable just going back and forth interrupting each other with stories, as my natural conversational rhythm is to ask people questions, silently listen, and wait for my turn to respond to what they’re saying, and them naturally asking questions like “what about you, do you relate?” 

My questions are: Should I try to adjust to her way of having conversations? and if not, how do I approach talking about this with her in a polite, constructive way? Why do you think she does this? 

TLDR: My girlfriend dominates conversations talking about her life, particularly past experiences, and does not ask me questions. She expresses herself well through text and other acts but not verbally. I don’t know what to do.

Help- my bf values alone time too much but I need more,"My (23M) bf and I (20F) of one year and I are currently on a 1 month no contact break rn. It is a healthy commited relationship and we are using the break to work on ourselves and have agreed to remain faithful to one another. I feel a lot of mixed emotions rn and I love him but I’m tied between thinking I deserve better or working through this break and come out stronger. My bf values his alone him A LOT. He hates calling and due to schedules I only see him once a week. He is someone who could probably be totally fine not having a relationship and if anything would probably prefer the alone time. On top of this he is very much laid back and prior to our break I brought up that I need more for this relationship to work. I want him to plan dates for us every now and then, surprise me with flowers once in awhile, and just put more effort into me. He is a very supportive kind person and I love him but I need change for this to work. A part of me feels like this is just who he is and maybe I do deserve someone who is more like me but I also don’t want to give up on him. He said he is willing to change and work on himself during this break, but I am worried of the possibility that nothing will change. I say this because he told me his exes brought up the same issues. He is truly a great guy and I don’t want to give up on him but I worry we are incompatible. What do I do in this situation?

"My (19F) boyfriend (25M) says he’s not flirting, but he talks to other girls on Snapchat and shuts me down when I bring it up and brushes off my feelings.","I’ve been in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (25M) for 8 months now. I’m 19. There’s a noticeable age gap, and while I initially thought he’d be more emotionally mature because of that, it’s been the opposite.

Every-time we have a quarrel he told me he uses Snapchat to talk to people “just for fun” and not in a flirty way—he insists it’s not just girls, but still, it bothers me. I don’t mind him having friends, but when he uses his free time to talk to others while I sit there missing him, it makes me feel like I’m not important. I told him this directly, asking him if he really thinks it’s fair that I’m just expected to stay silent and accept it.He told me that even when im talking to others he’s fine with it because that he trusts me and not he doesn’t feel like this is a threat to our relationship and told me not all people are always talking with others just to flirt but on Snapchat? Okay i don’t buy that to be honest but he also doesn’t look like he’s cheating as well.

Instead of addressing how I feel, he always says the conversation is going in “loops” and shuts it down. It’s incredibly frustrating. I’m not being controlling—I just want reassurance and to feel like a priority. But every time I try to express my feelings, he gets defensive, changes the topic, or emotionally shuts down completely. He always tell me he’s busy i know he is but has time to talk to other people what me?

I’m starting to believe he might have an avoidant attachment style. He’s told me in the past that he doesn’t really talk about his feelings, even when he’s going through something. But it’s affecting me. I always have to be the one initiating emotional conversations, and I constantly feel like I’m “too much” for having basic emotional needs.

The age gap, his emotional unavailability, and the fact that I’m always the one trying to resolve things—it’s becoming too heavy. I feel like I’m talking to a wall, and I’m starting to wonder if this is what I want or deserve in a relationship. He actually sometimes shows that he loves me and I am also moving there for my abroad study plan so I don’t know what to do….

⸻

TL;DR:
I’m (19F)in a long-distance relationship with my 25M boyfriend who uses Snapchat every-time we quarrel to casually talk to others (including girls), and it makes me feel unimportant. Every time I try to express my feelings, he avoids the conversation and says it’s “going in loops.” I think he has an avoidant attachment style, and I’m emotionally drained from always being the one to bring up serious topics while he shuts down. Not sure how much more I can take.",1,1kvook3,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvook3/my_19f_boyfriend_25m_says_hes_not_flirting_but_he/
I (31M) would like some advice if you have time,"Throughout my life I had crushes and it's been nothing but crushes. So I always have my heart cold. But I need some advice on this one situation that I am going through. I am REALLY blind to interactions where the woman is trying to get my attention. At work recently, I have a woman staring at me every now and then. Then one day she asked me where the yogurt was, and I showed her where it was at. Now every time I look at her, my heart starts tugging at it's strings. She is rather beautiful to me, but I have no experience nor confidence in intimate relationship. Was this an attempt on her behalf to get my attention?

"My gf 21F kissed another guy 41M, How do I move on from this?","**TL;DR My gf has feelings for a 40M man that lives in senegal , they kissed and she only just told me everything now, but she still loves me and is thinking about it .**

So my **GF (21)F** moved to Senegal last month for a 3 months internship in international relations (its a way to finish her course at her uni), we've been together for about a year and a half and everything as far as I know is doing great (we tell each other we love each other everyday, send good morning and goodnight texts, go on dates etc.). I **(20)M** recently she had feelings for some 40 year old man in senegal , that's been driving her and her friend around in Senegal for free, she also told me that they kissed , apparently they were very drunk and she forgot about it, (she did that arround 2 weeks ago and didnt tell me). So tonight she was driving arround with him in his car , and he told her he was in love with her , she kinda freaked out and directly texted me as soon as she got home. We had a discussion about it and she told me she was sorry and wanted to talk it out, but she also had feelings for him, (apparently he's kind and has a good soul), I told her to stop texting him and she said it would be hard to not talk to him since he's driving her arround and she works with him too and she's not sure of her feelings either. She said to me she would love to live in Senegal and has nothing back in Montreal, she's been considering staying in senegal with him and escape her family (wich is a fair point because there's a lot of emotional abuse). All I know about her \*crush\* is that he's arround 40, he's nice and is having a decent life in Senegal. So how do I move on from, well this mess. I'm not mad at her , people can have crushes and everything I'm not the jealous type, but the fact that she was talking to him for well over a month and didn't tell me anything  is honestly soul crushing . So how do I move on from that , my first thought was to leave her and handle the consequences of her actions (but its just a kiss so I don't really care that much) , she says she loves me and everything but it falls a bit flat after leaving me in the dark for so long. (She also has feelings for him)  .So how do I move on from that , do I talk to her and let her live her life, or do I try and salvage that ship.

  
\*Please don't insult her .I know how it sounds and in my mind that guy is clearly manipulating her but I'd like some input from other people.

"Help- My girlfriend 27, says our relationship is a sin and we shall go to hell. What should I do?","27, female, pansexual. I've been dating an out lesbian for now 4 months and we were recently talking about the Bible and religion. She mentioned that one thing for sure for her is that she does not doubt anything thats in the Bible, so I asked her, well, the Bible is not in support of our relationship, do you believe that? She said yes. 

I asked, so you sleep every night believing you'll go to hell? She said yes. And I don't know how that made me feel. I mean, I am spiritual. But I believe that God, supports love. And so I know the God I believe in would not punish me for being in love with a fellow woman. 

But at the same time, this leaves me thinking, will she eventually just up and go? Once she decides she's done with sinning? And is all the future we planned going to go out the window? What do yall think? Am I overthinking? I just kinda think that's a Red flag ish. Cause I am now feeling not secure in the relationship.  Idk. And she said she doesn't even pray for the sin itself.

I (19F) like but don't love my boyfriend (M21),"I (F19) would like to hear from people if theyve felt the same. I just want to know if these feelings are normal.  

I’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year. I really like him. He’s smart, sweet, funny, and incredibly kind. He’s getting his PhD, he treats me so well, and he really *loves* me. We get along great, we have chemistry, he gets along with my family. In so many ways, he’s everything I should want.

But here’s the thing: sometimes I love him… and sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I’m so excited to see him, like he’s all I want. Other times, I feel completely indifferent. It feels like a chore to hang out. I’ve felt like this since the beginning, off and on. It comes in waves. And it’s *not* anything he does. It just happens. Maybe it’s hormonal (with girls 28 day cycles lol), maybe it’s just me, but it makes me feel awful.

He was the first one to say “I love you,” about a month into the relationship. I definitely wouldn’t have said it that early. hes only my second boyfriend so im not sure if thats normal to say it that early. He sometimes talks about a future together, and there are moments when I like that idea. But other times, it makes me feel trapped or uncertain. i dont *not* but i dont exactly see a future *with* him. I mean, its impossible predict the future, so i dont really like to think/talk about it. 

 I wish I had butterflies, but mostly I just feel… I don’t know. Numb? Neutral? 

He’s not exactly my physical “type” either. He’s super cute i do like the way he looks.  but sometimes I find myself fantasizing about someone else. I feel terrible even admitting that.

It’s not like I’m ashamed of my boyfriend. I’m not. I just keep thinking: shouldn’t I feel more than this? Shouldn’t I *want* to be with him all the time? I didn’t feel this kind of emotional rollercoaster with my ex, but maybe we just weren’t together long enough. Still, I was always excited to see him.

I just want to feel that real, deep, overwhelming kind of love. The kind you see in movies like. I know that’s dramatic and unrealistic, but I crave that kind of passion. 

And I’m scared. I’m scared that if I leave J (my boyfriend) for someone who makes me feel that spark, I’ll regret it. What if I get my heart broken? What if I never find someone as good as him again? He’s honestly the full package: smart, stable, kind, emotionally available. I’m terrified of ruining something good because of a feeling I don’t even fully understand.

I would *never* cheat. That’s not even a question. But I notice other guys. I don’t act on anything, and I don’t flirt, but I see people and wonder what it would be like. There’s one guy I recently met who I think is really cool, and I caught myself wishing *he* was my boyfriend. I’d never do anything with him, and honestly I’d just like to be friends, but it still makes me feel guilty.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m just afraid of settling. Not that I *think* I’m settling with J , but I worry that someday I’ll look back and think I missed out on the kind of love I actually wanted. And yet, if someone ever felt about *me* the way I’m feeling now about J, it would destroy me. I’d be devastated.

I keep going through these apathetic, detached phases where I just feel nothing. and on bad days i feel straight up annoyed with him for no reason. And then they pass, and I feel more connected again. I really hope this is one of those phases that will pass soon. I just want to be excited again. I want to feel in love.

But is that *really* necessary? Is excitement even sustainable in a long-term relationship? Or is it more important to have someone who’s kind, loving, and consistent? 

J and I have had hard moments, but we’ve worked through them. I really value that. I like being with someone I can solve problems with instead of just giving up. We come out stronger and more mature as a result.  That means a lot to me. I’m not the kind of person to walk away just because things get hard. But right now, I don’t know what I’m feeling. I just know that I feel torn, guilty, and confused.

If you’ve ever felt like this in a relationship? like you’re in something good, but you don’t always feel it. what did you do? Did the feelings come back? Did you leave and regret it?  Did anyone leave their partner and find someone who they were truly in love with? 

I just need to know if anyone else has been here.

sorry this has been kind of a rant. i just dont know what to do :/ 

  
TL:DR, I like by current boyfriend, but i dont love him. I wish i was more passionate and excited. I just want to know if this is normal in a relationship. Is being totally in love always necessary? Has anyone felt this way towards a partner?  ",2,1kvmphp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvmphp/i_19f_like_but_dont_love_my_boyfriend_m21/
My girlfriend (23F) hasn't been the same since we had sex two months ago? (26M)," We dated in the past for three months in 2024, but she broke up with me and ghosted me. I dated someone else for six months a few months after that relationship ended, and during that time, my ex got jealous and begged me to come back to her, texting me constantly, bringing me gifts, etc. I felt really bad because I knew how badly I wanted her back too, but I was very weary of doing such a thing, especially given how the relationship ended last time. Plus, I was ""dating"" another girl for 6 months (she refused to put a label on it because she was not over her ex, which was a mistake even getting into that on my part) After my other relationship ended because she went back to her ex-boyfriend, my ex and I got back together. Things were great at first, we would go out, have fun, kiss al the time, have sex a lot, the whole 9 yards. but two months ago, during sex, she started crying and said it was extremely painful. She said it just hurt very bad, and she was not sure why. Since then, she's been distant, less affectionate, and seems unhappy.

She went to the doctor to talk about it, and all they did was change her birth control. We talked, and she said she's depressed, (which she has always talked about since I have known her.) but I'm not seeing any changes; I know from experience that depression hits hard, but she is on a high dose of medicine, and I feel as though the way she has been treating me has not been a result from that. She's on Lexapro and birth control, which I know can affect hormones and mood. She's also been going out with her friends without inviting me, even though all their boyfriends are there. It makes me feel awful, because I want to be seen as her boyfriend, not someone she uses as emotional support when she is bored. She's canceled plans we've made, which has become an occurrence ever since the painful sex and emotional switch up, and it feels like I'm walking on eggshells around her. Overall, I have become quite unhappy, and even after we had a talk about this stuff, nothing has really changed. Overall, she has become very emotionally distant over time since that night. How can I fix this? I am at a loss, and I dont want to breakup with her because I love her very much, but at this point I am at a loss. I have apologized a lot to her, and tried to make her happy to get us back to where we were emotionally, but nothing seems to be working. I just want my girlfriend back.
TLDR: My girlfriend broke up with me, ghosted me, then got super jealous when I started dating someone else and begged me to come back. We eventually got back together, and things were great until she experienced painful sex. Since then, she's been distant, depressed, and less affectionate. She's excluding me from her social life and canceling plans, making me feel like an emotional crutch. I've tried apologizing and making her happy, but nothing's changed, and I'm at a loss. I love her and don't want to break up, but I just want my girlfriend back.

I (39M) have been with my gf (33F) for 2 years but the spark hasn’t been there. What should I do?,"When I got with my girlfriend, I was in a hurt state since everyone I dated either didn’t know what they wanted or would just date me but then leave. It lead me to believe that love doesn’t really happen; I wouldn’t find love and I would just have to make it happen with someone who “checks all the boxes” like having a good head on their shoulders, and loves me. And I didn’t need the spark to be there. I would let it be and grow one day at a time. Then I met my girlfriend who is a great person and is there for me all the time. We have a good connection, yet the intimacy (romance, sexual attraction) isn’t there. 

I tried my best to either remember all the good things she brings to the table or look at other things that might make her more attractive. But unfortunately, it hasn’t gotten to the point where I would want to hug her, hold her hand, miss/think of her, etc. I feel like we are together but from a distance. And she realizes it. And fast forward to the present and much hasn’t changed and we both have talked about the idea of moving from each other. 

I’ve finally learned that I did need that spark this whole time to make this work. I ignored it because so many women would tell me that they didn’t feel the spark for me. And I just decided that it wasn’t needed. It’s like I lost hope in love and that it was just an idea. But honestly, it’s not. 

Recently I met someone unexpectedly who is very interested in me and I’m interested in her the same way. And it feels so so so good! It’s like that love I’ve always wanted finally appeared and I’m grateful for it. It’s made me believe all over again after years of being heartbroken. We look eye to eye with alot of things and it makes me feel super happy. I did tell her that I’m in a relationship recently, and she had to take a step back for now since the only way we can continue is for me to be single (as she says, it’s a pause and not a goodbye).

For now, I’m at the final stage of my relationship. I do feel like we are like good friends and I do have love for her but I am not in love with her. I want us to be happy in the end because that’s most important. I would want her to be with someone who gives her all the love she deserves-the stuff I couldn’t give her unfortunately. It would be hard and painful to break up with her yet the more I stay in the relationship, the more I’ll feel unhappy and just feel like I’m in the relationship to do the right thing for her but not for me. And I want to be happy as well. It’s been 2 years that I’ve been struggling to love her the right way but man, it’s been tough. I tried so hard. 

So I just want to know your thoughts and if you’ve had any similar experiences to this? Would love to know your take on this. 

TL;DR been with my (39m) gf(32f) for 2 years and the spark hasn’t been quite there. The romance and sexual attraction isn’t quite as strong and I’m realizing that I need the spark.

I (26m) have a question regarding a fwb type of situation with (27f),"This is gonna be an odd one.  
I went out with this girl a few times, over the course of about a month.  Developed feelings.  We ended up being incompatible.  Decided to remain friends.  I think I mostly have lost the feelings.  

The odd thing is, she still wants to kiss and do foreplay type stuff.  We have never had sex.  I am a virgin. 

Tonight I exercised and was texting her about it.  She said that she could use some exercise, in the form of an F buddy.  So I asked if that was an invite to come over.  She texts back “only if we have sex”.  So I more or less agreed.  Then says she won’t have sex with me because I’m a virgin.  I asked why, and it is because she thinks I would get attached.  I’m okay with her choice.  

But why hang that over my head?  What is she trying to do?  The answer is a hard no, yet she texts stuff like that or lets me do just about everything else.  

TL;DR fwb situation that I have not had sex with texts me about wanting sex but won’t do it bc I’m a virgin

How to overcome the anxiety of hookups?,"

I've(25M)  been talking with some guys on a dating app and we've been sexting for a while and I want to take to the next level and have a meeting (sexually), we both do.

I've always been afraid of meeting either sexual or non sexual. I'm really excited but when we talk about meeting the anxiety it's really bad. I don't feel satisfied with my sexuality, I feel the need to have this dates but I can't...

Anyone have this problems? How did you overcome the? I need to block this anxiety once and for all. In the last 3 years I did 8 hookups and in every one of them I was like terrified and forced myself to it, then I enjoyed it but it was so bad the feeling until we actually start doing the thing...

Boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) have been together for 4 years (and been friends for years more) and he says he isn't ready to grow up and that proposing to me is on his to-do list. How do I help us?,"There will be a lot of reading here, fair warning, I'll include short summary at the bottom


So, my bf and were friends in 7th grade and only starting becoming best friends in high school. His father had just died, I was living in an abusive home, and we became really great shoulders to lean on. We came to the conclusion that we absolutely loved each other and wanted to be together forever no matter what. We want to get married, have kids, grow old together. He has been my rock through thick and thin, he taught me that it's okay to cry, he showed me how beautiful life can be, he kept me on this Earth just by being himself, and I've apparently done the same for him.

That being said, there are some bumps in our love story.

Within these past 2 years, he's been growing really anxious about loosing all this 'time' to do things he wants to do, like work on little hobbies and projects he makes for himself. He works 4 days a week, 12am-7, and had 3 days off in a row. He has plenty of time, but he still makes it as an excuse to stay up super late, to not do other household responsibilities, to not take a shower and take care of himself.

We'll be talking and he will bring up all the things that are stressing him out, they are things that aren't happening yet; paying bills and stuff (he doesn't pay rent, doesn't pay car bills or car insurance, doesn't even pay his phone bill). He says one thing that stresses him out is proposing to me and it's on his to-do list. That kinda hurts me, but I understand where he's coming from. It is a big decision, but it's one I thought we already agreed upon many times.

I am worried that when we do get married (if we ever do), that he'll be miserable, that when we have kids, he will be unhappy. I just want him to be happy. I've asked him many times if he would want a break, if he is sure he wants to be marry me... he always says he does but that he's just scared. Idk what that means or what I can do about that other than wait longer for him to get his shit together.

I can't leave him, but I don't know what to do. His behavior is hurting me, and I keep trying to help him, I keep bringing these issues up, but all that ever does is upsets him and then he goes back into his routine and going through the motions.

I understand not wanting to grow up, but just because you're an adult doesn't mean you stop enjoying life and everything sucks now. At 20, you're either a responsible or irresponsible adult, and right now he's the latter. I so badly want to help him. I so badly want him to be happy, if me leaving does that I'll do it.

I so badly want to marry him. I so badly want to be happy. I love him for who he is, but I so badly want him to grow up.

Is there any advice anyone is willing to give me? I'm at crossroads here, idk what to think. Am I crazy? Ik we're still young, am I being dramatic?


TL;DR

Boyfriend is a great guy but says he doesn't wanna grow up, is scared to propose to me. He is showing bad habits and behaviors that make me anxious for the future such as laziness and bad hygiene, and I don't know what to do about it. Do I leave? Do we take a break?

I(18F) miss my boyfriend(18M) all day but when he gets to talk I don’t want to anymore?,"So recently my boyfriend got a job. He took a break from working because of school and sports so when sports ended we had a lot of time to be on the phone(we are long distance). And today he went to work in the morning and got back late at night. I missed him all day and was thinking about him but when he called me while I was in the bath I didn’t want to talk to him anymore? I thought it was because I had been out with my mom all day in the sun and going places and I just want some alone time to relax, but I feel like there’s more to it because every time he is gone all day and we don’t talk much it doesn’t matter what I’m doing I still don’t want to talk when he gets done, it’s like I want more time alone. I read a little bit and someone talked about how some times they will push away in a similar way because they have a fear of abandonment and I felt like that might be why I “push away” too. But then I thought “well he wasn’t even gone for that long and he answered me when he could it’s not like it felt like he was leaving”, but on the other hand maybe it feels like he’s just moving on in his own life without me?

TL;DR
When my boyfriend is busy all day I miss him but when he can finally text and call me I don’t want to talk to him anymore and I just want to be left alone. Why is that?

Muslim bf’s parents don’t like me and it feels like a deal breaker,"
TLDR: my bf and I have been together for 1.5 years but his parents don’t accept me and I’m scared for the future. 

My bf (25m) and I (26f) have been together for 1.5 years. He is Muslim and I am Christian, but we are both nonpracticing. I love him and he loves me and we’ve spoken about a future together. We’ve agreed on raising our children to choose their own religion and he agreed to move back to my home town with me when I decide I’m over living in NY. We wanted to move in together, but decided not to because it would make his parents uncomfortable. I met his mom a few months ago and it was nice but felt like she was vetting me more than trying to get to know me. His dad would not acknowledge our relationship for the longest time and is depressed/not eating due to the relationship. He has met my parents and stayed at my family’s house for the holidays. I am afraid the rest of our lives is going to be a challenge. I am afraid his parents will never love me and will try to influence our relationship and choices at every step. He says they won’t but I don’t think he is being realistic. I am at the crossroads of breaking up with him or staying with him and committing to the idea that life might be hard with him but at least he’s an amazing parter/person. I am afraid of making the wrong choice and missing out on a life with someone else who may be better suited to me and whose family will accept me for who I am.

How do I(23f) navigate and process my grief with my partner (25M),"How do I(23f) navigate and process my grief with my partner 25M)

My father passed suddenly last year. My partner and I were living in Alaska. We moved back to Colorado and now rent a home. Recently my grief has gotten worse. I find myself not wanting to hang out with him. I would rather be doing things on my own. I know this hurts him. I communicated with him that I’m struggling, but I’m worried it’ll push him away. I am easily irritable, crying, and sad. He gets upset and hurt when I tel him I don’t want to hang out(play video games, go on walks…etc).

I went to church today, and I have found a safe space for me. A place where I don’t feel alone. A place where I don’t feel judged for needing time for myself.

I was having a hard time yesterday(brothers graduation without my father present) and he brought up that we should have sex. I said no I don’t want to, then he got upset and said I owe him money for lunch. Something about that interaction pushed me to the edge. I want to lock myself away. I’ll be talking to him about something serious and he’ll just grab my boobs and try to touch me. I’m obviously not okay, and don’t know why he does this.

——-

There are also other issues. Since my father died I have been overly concerned for my partners health(300lbs). He asks for help with diet, exercise…etc but complains when he has to do it. He has a fungal infection on his feet yet won’t go to the doctor. He let his ingrown toenail get infected and even though I was telling him he needs to go to the doctor he wouldn’t. He also struggles to brush his teeth regularly. I’m very concerned about his physical health and it scares me that I could also lose him due to this.

TL;DR: I don’t know how I’m supposed to process my grief with a partner who does not seem mature in all aspects of life, but I also do care deeply and he has been there for me through this process, so how have you navigated grief while having a partner?

So, my sister (27F) and her fiance (32M) live at my mom’s house with us. They have been together for 5 years. And lived together with us for 3. Ever since the beginning my sister has made it apparently clear that he always says he hates me and my mom which makes no sense for a variety of reasons, but especially because my mother provides for him and he is just rude in return. And he thinks it’s funny. 
Anyways tonight I was trying to let him know a pan was hot and to not touch it and he wouldn’t even acknowledge me then said sarcastically “oh yea the first thing I’ll do is touch the pans”. I was a bit upset by that because it felt unnecessarily rude. My mom then OFFERED (for free) for them to have our couch when they move, and he rolled his eyes instead of responding. Mind you they had just gotten home after a fun day so I don’t think anyone can justify this attitude. Even further for context, he is always rude. He makes rude jokes about me or at me about things that I do or say due to my diagnosed autism. And he constantly makes rude statements about my widowed mother who works insanely hard to keep this roof over our heads. He is extremely condescending and racist and misogynistic. My sister always used to stand up for me but she just excuses it when he does it. She even agrees with him now which hurts. But because I’m nice I still have tried tirelessly since they moved in to make small talk with him or engage with him about his interests yet he ignores me or finds a way to make a condescending joke about me. I’m nothing but nice and kind to him. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Also should add before he ever moved in (first 2 years of their relationship) he literally didn’t say a word to me and I mean for EXTENDED periods of time like 6 hour family party’s would blatantly ignore me and not acknowledge my presence. But then other times he’s randomly nice to me or asks me a thoughtful question. It’s so confusing. But he still seems to do it in a idc I’m just asking cause I have to way. I know he hates me but I just don’t know why? ",1,1kvl9cm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvl9cm/does_my_sisters_27f_fiance_32m_hate_me_20m_or_am/
can’t hold relationships no matter what i do?,"am i doing something wrong in every relationship i try?

so there isn’t specifics to a certain relationship i’m focusing on but i’m looking at them as a whole. i end up meeting someone, hitting it off, texting a lot, having a lot in common, they seem to be into it too, lowkey lovebomb, and then just ignore / ghost me. i genuinely DO not know what i’m doing wrong because I’m a people pleaser, I’m always the type to reply fast, etc. i just don’t know what it is with me. every relationship i try or try to build just goes the exact same way. i genuinely feel like i’ve been CURSED.

since i do need to include ages for the post to be valid, i am (18F) and the past two i’m hung up over were (24M) and (22M)

TL;DR
I keep trying to build relationships, and they always start off great. we hit it off, text a lot, have a lot in common, and sometimes they even lovebomb me. But then, out of nowhere, they ignore me or ghost me. I honestly don’t know what I’m doing wrong because I’m a people pleaser, I reply quickly, and I try my best. This keeps happening in every relationship I try, and it feels like I’m cursed.",3,1kvl758,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvl758/cant_hold_relationships_no_matter_what_i_do/
Moved back in with my ex — feeling more tension and not sure what to do,"We’re both in our 30s. A few years ago, we lived together but broke up due to different views on life. It was a painful breakup. After emigrating, we started talking more, and a few months ago we moved in together. It was mostly a forced decision: he lost his job, and I offered him to stay with me.

At first, everything was calm. But recently, there’s been more tension.

Example of a recent situation:
He didn’t sleep at night, was in the living room with his laptop. I woke up a couple of times during the night, and around 6 AM I saw he was starting to fall asleep. I suggested he move to the bedroom so he could rest better, since I would need to use the kitchen (which is combined with the living room).
He came to the bedroom with his laptop. On his nightstand there was a hairdryer and a bottle of grooming spray for the dog — I had used it earlier in the day while bathing his dog. He removed the hairdryer and dropped the bottle to the floor to make space for the laptop. I asked him to please put the bottle on my nightstand instead, because it leaks, and handed it to him.

After that, he started saying that I never clean up after myself and raised his voice. He said I’m manipulative, that my care is fake, that I pressure him, and that I should have removed the bottle earlier. I asked if he had talked to any friends about moving in with them since I clearly annoy him so much. He asked if I wanted him to leave. I said no — there are things I like about living together — but if it’s this hard for him, I can’t live in constant tension. I suggested joint therapy. He refused and said the problem is mine, not his, and that I need therapy to learn how to communicate. He’s been in individual therapy for years. Then he got angry, grabbed his dog, and went outside for a walk — at 6 AM. He came back after about 15–20 minutes.

Later that day, I suggested we go for a walk together, but said I wasn’t ready to continue the earlier conversation. He sarcastically asked why.

I feel very confused. Maybe I’m overthinking things and it’s just a rough patch? But maybe it’s time to ask him to move out — I just don’t know how to do that without feeling guilty for ending things. Or maybe there’s still a chance to fix it?

We live together due to necessity. A couple of months were really good, but lately, things have become more tense. He’s increasingly irritated with me. The last fight started because he dropped a grooming spray bottle from his nightstand (after I had used it while grooming his dog) and was angry I hadn’t cleaned it up. Now I don’t know — am I in the wrong here, or should I really start thinking how to ask him to move out?

⸻

TL;DR:
Started living again with ex due to necessity. First few months were great, but now he gets irritated a lot, yells, and refuses therapy. Last fight was at 6AM over a spilled bottle of dog grooming spray. He says I’m manipulative and don’t care. I feel confused: am I wrong or should I ask him to move out? How do I do that without feeling guilty?

Should I (32M) be worried about my partner’s (29F) sudden decrease in libido?,"As the title says, I’ve noticed a sudden decrease in her desire to have sex. Recently moved in together after being (sort of long distance) we were only 2 hours apart so one of us would drive to the other one weekly!

Never had a long term relationship, I do love this woman. I totally respect if she has a different sex drive to me, I guess I’m just asking if anyone else has experienced a lull after the honeymoon phase? 

My worry is she isn’t interested anymore!

please help me with my family.,"hi everyone! Im desperate for answers. I really need help, like so bad. Questions are listed at the bottom. im going to dive in and give a detailed backstory, so this may be kinda long. I am 20 and my younger sister is 17. I am a college student. My parents are together and come from two different racial backgrounds (mom is white and dad is black). 

My parents laid extremely high expectations for both me and my sister from the time we were in kindergarten. But, I noticed as I dove into a competitive sport at 8yrs old, the treatment between the two of us began drastically changing. My dad was very involved in this sport; I needed to practice everyday, that’s reasonable! As I got older, this sport grew into a monster, I was playing at the highest level and almost committed to the University of Georgia to play. So through highschool I struggled with super tough coaches (1 of which got fired from 3 highschools for mental abuse) so it was just a very heavy weight to carry at my age. There was no offseason so I was gone all summer for 3/4 summers straight, and every day after school was dedicated to practicing. I didnt mind this, but my mom is heavily dedicated to school. She would hammer down on me if i didnt have straight a’s in my all AP (advanced placement) classes. I had tutoring twice a week and ACT prep once a week. This was my life from ages 12-18. I quit my sport in april2023 and my dad was devasted, he immediately made me search for a job for that summer as soon as I got out of school, so i got a job working 5days a week at the ymca childrens center. In the moment I didnt mind any of this until I left for college. 

Once I left for college in 2023, I decided I was going to major in computer engineering. My relationship with my parents was extremely rocky due to me wanting to explore and have some freedom without them. I ended up doing okay my first semester, but in February of 2024 i hit the darkest place ive been in my entire life and failed all of my classes, leading to my suspension from the university. I was in over my head in all of my classes. My parents were awful to me through the entire freshman year of college, never asking about my mental health. Only cared about my grades and told me to do some “soul searching”. I was forced to tell them in May2024 that I failed out and they were disappointed but acted sympathetic. Now that its been a year, im back in school at a community college seeking my associates degree and then I plan on returning to the engineering school at the same university this December. 

Since quitting sport (which was my dads thing), and failing school (which was my moms thing) i feel like both parents hold a significant amount of resentment towards me. When I was 16, i got my moms hand me down 2011 maxima, which I was EXTREMELY grateful for, took great care of and love it. I still drive this same car with huge damages to it from someone hitting me. I pay for my rent, gas money, and groceries, which I do feel like is a fair for a 20 year old to be paying. Ive had job after job since for the past 2 years.
But….
My sister, who is 17, got a brand new 2021 nissan altima last year. She has no pressure to be in any AP classes, she doesnt have a job, she doesnt play sports. She has no pressures in life, which has set her up for a great success in my opinion; she can seek out opportunities for herself without feeling forced by someone and like its a chore, she has picked up small hobbies in her free time. She goes to school, which shes late for all the time, comes home takes a shower and takes a nap. She stays in her room all the time, whereas I am always socializing with my parents. 
This started from a young age. When I entered middle school, I wanted to wear makeup and my mom got me clear mascara and chapstick; when my sister entered 4th grade she had an entire youtube channel dedicated to makeup, she had an entire vanity of expensive makeup. She has a brand new furniture set in her room and I have old furniture that my granny gave us. These are just simple examples but i could go on forever with this. 

I love my younger sister to death, and I dont blame her. Sometimes she acts like a brat and looks down on me because I dont have some of the nice things like she has, or she’ll throw an insult at my car or my room saying its dirty but i dont mind because she doesnt know any better. I try not to resent her, its really hard. I do love her shes amazing and shes like my best friend but i have moments where I just have to be alone from my family. 

The most significant time period of my life with my parents is when I decided I was not going to play my sport in college (march2023-aug2023 when i left for college). My dad became physically abusive on one occasion because I didnt have time to do the dishes in between me arriving home from school and having to leave for practice. I went to practice with a busted lip, bleeding nose, and huge bruise on my forehead. My younger sister saw, my mom wasnt home. My mom was physically abusive on multiple occasions and quite frequently prior to this incident, but i could hold her off. Obviously it was different than when my dad did it. Theyve never laid a hand on my sister other than a whoopin here or there when we were younger. 

I just moved home from college yesterday, so we decided to go out to eat for dinner. I was cheery and in a great mood, dressed for the occasion appropriately, making conversation the whole way, laughing and trying to be pleasant. My sister, sat with her airpods in, my mom had to buy her a new outfit since she didnt dress right, and she had a horrible attitude the entire time bc she (didnt want to spend her sunday doing this). She didnt even order food at the restaurant. When we sat down for dinner, my parents and I had a huge argument. I was discussing babysitting the family I have babysat for a little over a year now. When i left for college, I gave the family my sisters phone number in case they needed a babysitter. She babysat for them a handful of times. I have been scheduled to nanny for them 4 days a week this summer, and i offered her 1 day so she can make a little bit of money since shes not getting a job. At the dinner table she had an attitude about wanting to babysit 2 days instead of 1. I clapped back at her, since shes been bringing the energy down all day I was just sick and tired of it and i said maybe you should get a job if you want more money. Who has a brand new car and doesnt have a job. My parents got furious that I said that, their only explanation was that it was their decision to “parent how they want to parent”. They were infuriated with me, instead of with the child that has been ruining the entire day with her selfish attitude! 

I know that parenting style differs from older sibling to younger sibling, we are two different people so I completely understand that! I just dont feel like its normal for me to feel this way, and I don’t feel like this is traditional or normal. My whole family has tons of built up resentment towards each other, with my grandparents, aunts uncles cousins etc.

Now that you guys know my whole life story!!! 😂

Questions : 
- I am absolutely terrified to pass this treatment down to my children. How can I prevent this? 
- I want to live a happy, successful life. Should I seek therapy to help deal with all of the emotions and baggage this brings? 
- I do love my parents even though its been really hard. It would be hard, financially, to cut them out. How can I deal with this moving forward? 
- am i incorrect for feeling some resentment towards my sister?


i just really need some kind words and motivation because I am crying writing this. I just dont understand how you could treat a real person like this for so long. I am not trying to play the victim. Sometimes i think its me, is it me? I dont understand why everything is targeted towards me. I tried to explain this in a non-bias way so that you guys could form your own opinions about it. Thank you guys for reading and I already appreciate you for taking the time to read all of this. 🩷 

tl;dr Ive been dealing with the drastic differences of my parents parental style between my sister and I for 10 years.

Spouse (40f) is depressed and its my fault,"# Me (39m) Wife (40f) is depressed and its is my fault. We have three kids, 16, 14, and 11. I'm very distressed because I want my kids to grow up in a loving home. Sadly, My wife and I had marital trouble early in the marriage. We were unfaithful to each other before we had children and the resentment has surfaced in the past 8 years. I fear she has been depressed without me knowing for a very long time now. There are so many triggers that set her off and this usually results in her making a series of accusations, that although founded, she wants to discuss all night long and into the next day. There seems to be no end in sight as this has been going on for years now. I'm exhausted. I want to give my children a good home and I've been failing miserably. I know both our actions had consequences that are impacting our kids. I for the most part have accepted what happened and have decided to move past it for the sake of the kids. Her on the other hand is having a very difficult time. She has had dark thoughts in the past. The mood cycles are killing me. She is angry, sad, leaves, comes back, makes demands, threatens divorce... I just want to reduce the collateral damage as much as possible.. My kids are great kids. We both love them very much. They do not know their mom is depressed, or why she is depressed, but of course, they are witnessing her just leave out of the blue and she sleeps on the couch often, so they know something is up, just not the details or how bad it is. I can't even bring myself to enjoy activities with them because I'm constantly anxious, sleep deprived trying to be supportive of her, and honestly, just feels very crappy when she is not there and I just know that we are in for a hellish 1 or two weeks until it sorta passes and then starts again the next month or so. I don't know if I should confide to the kids that their mom is depressed and I don't know how much I should tell them. I obviously do not want to make her out to be the villain. She will not see a therapist. That just won't happen. She goes over and over the same mistakes, although never really taking accountability for her transgressions. I just listen and try to deescalate because I want to avoid the chaos.. Divorce is not an options because in her condition, I fear that it would be worse for her and also the kids since I have a gut feeling that the depression will not go away after the divorce and then the kids will be the ones to pick up the pieces.

 TL;DR! Wife is depressed. it is my fault and I don't know how to handle it and do what is best for the kids.",0,1kvkqpb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvkqpb/spouse_40f_is_depressed_and_its_my_fault/
18f and 18m 1 month together but male is homeless,"Please, I need advice about my daughter’s new relationship and I realize this isn’t my relationship but I think this is the best group to ask. 

My daughter is graduating in two days; about to get a car, is pursuing a doctorate, plans on living at home, is employed at a minimum wage job. She met this boy, and shared he’s from a giant family and the parents are abusive and controlling and his mom kicked him out to sleep outside multiple times a week and he’s frequently in tears. He supposedly is enrolled at a tech college, and is employed at a minimum wage job. 

About one week after dating, he chose to leave home and be homeless. He was sleeping outside in a ghetto, unsafe part of town, so through my daughter, I gave him a list of resources for homelessness. I have given him two bikes but they keep getting stolen. 

At the start, I told my daughter he might be the soulmate for her she thinks he is, but I cannot allow her to be with a boy whose circumstances will drag her down. He needs to stay in school, keep his job, work toward transportation, and find safe housing of some sort. I said she can wait for him to get there, but I need to limit their time together until he’s ready to be in a relationship. My expectation of her is to stay employed, focus on starting college, and handle her own responsibilities. 

So now we get to my concerns. They are SO invested in each other but he doesn’t seem to be making good choices or have any drive at all. He seems to be perfectly fine with surviving versus living. He got a second job but I just heard he’s at risk of losing his first one because he’s too exhausted from biking all the time. He hasn’t gone to any of the places I recommended that can give him food, clothes, help with the bus system, register him as homeless so he can get free tuition and put financial aid towards his needs, etc. 

All I see is my daughter and him on FaceTime 24/7, gaming together, texting, he shows up at her job so they can hang out before work, she stays late to see him at work, he visits on break, etc. 

I get that he needs help, but my daughter is newly an adult about to start college and her focus should be on good grades, making friends, staying employed, diving into a hobby, and not finagling ways to see this boy every spare second and have to leave work crying because he texted that he got hit by a car on his bike but he’s ok, and then ask to see her therapist because she’s so worried about him. 

I don’t know where to draw the line. I don’t want to forbid them talking because that won’t work, but the more I let them talk and see one another the more in love they fall! Once my daughter has her car all bets are off. I worry all her time will go to shuttling him around, and she’ll buy him clothes and food and drive him to and from work and put her stuff to the side. 

How can I support her choice of boyfriend but still keep her on a growth and success path so she doesn’t hold herself back for this guy? My daughter is super reasonable and respectful and we have an amazing relationship and I’ve talked with her about my concerns, but—-she’s still just an 18 yr old with her first official boyfriend and says she’s in love. 

TL:DR: daughter has a boyfriend who is homeless and they’re in love and I know he’s a great guy but my expectations are for her to grow and move toward success, not get dragged down.

Struggling to trust my (33F) partner (35M),"hello all, sorry for the throw away, I don't want my partner to see this.

My partner (35M) and myself (33F) have been in a relationship for 5.5 years. During that time, I have had many conversations about the fact he doesn't 'hear' me. eg we'll be watching TV and I will say his name, or something, and he will not even flinch. I have waited minutes at a time. When I ask again he briskly will answer me, or just say ""yeah yeah"". It makes me feel like a nag. I think in his mind he has already responded to me, so when I ask a second time, he is annoyed that I am bothering him.  
  
When I have had this conversation with him, he says that when he is watching TV, ""nothing and no one else exists"" and so he cant ""see me"" in the black void around the screen. I asked him if our dog is there in his visions, and he says ""yes"", but I am not there too -- hence why he doesn't register that I have said anything.

For years now, this has made me feel like I am talking to myself, or a blank wall, and doesn't feel very nice at all.

over the past 3 years, we have lived together alone. he has an issue saving money, where the other year I was covering all bills. when he would say he'd like to contribute, I knew he didn't have loads of money, so I would ask him to instead put $50 towards our joint savings.

9 months go by and I checked the savings account...nothing had been transferred, even when he told me he would. That made me feel awful and like I couldn't trust him to be honest with me.

Then we went overseas saying ""don't worry baby, I've got you, money stuff is all sorted"", only to run out part way through (he didn't tell me earlier which would have allowed me to take money out of my savings app which takes 5 business days to clear into my account) and have to borrow money from his mum. Again, this felt like I couldn't trust him completely to follow through.

This year has been a lot. I have really wide feet and struggle to find dressy shoes I like. Finally, I found some and spent $300. The heel broke after a few weeks, and I got a refund. I could keep the shoes as they didn't have a replacement for me. As they were my only heels that I could wear, I of course kept them, and asked my partner to glue the chipped heel back on. He is a shoemaker and we have every kind of machine, glue, vice, and tool a footwear make could need in his workshop.

He knew how much I struggled with shoes, so he of course said ""I can fix those! it's easy, I will just buy a special glue."" That was back in early February. it is now the end of May and the shoes have not been fixed, despite me very softly asking once a month to see when they might be ready. I am traveling to Europe in 9 days for my goddaughter's baptism, and these are the shoes I am planning to wear. I had asked him ages ago if he could fix it so that I could test them out to make sure they wouldn't break again straight away, He said ""of course"". Now, he still hasn't touched them or even remembered to do them. He said he would do it last Thursday but ended up resting and watching TV instead.

I brought this up with him yesterday. That I feel hurt when he doesn't do the things he says he will (like wash the dog...it has been three months now). I know he is dyslexic -- I have ADHD and undiagnosed autism. I am the eldest daughter and grew up in an abusive home. I so badly thought that I could finally let my guard down and trust this man but it seems I can't and it is really breaking me from the inside.

I am extremely empathetic towards his experience as a neurodivergent person. I offer to book his doctor appointments for him because I know he gets overwhelmed. I organise everything to do with our rental home. We recently moved house after getting an intention to sell notice. He was overwhelmed and I didn't want him to be, so I took on all the house hunting and he liked one! so I pushed through and got us the house he wanted (he needed a big workshop). I handled all realestate stuff, all safety inspections, telling the real estate all the things that are wrong with the house, while also trying to manage my small business that I am always stressed about, on top of trying to make money to actually pay rent.

He started a new job where he works 4 days a week as a design and technology assistant in a high school. I am glad he loves his job! I am really really happy. I had spent hours after my 12 hour work days to come and help him apply for jobs - long drawn out applications that I did happily because he was stressed and uncomfortable. I do all of these at the drop of a hat - because I know it took SO much energy to ask for the help... Sadly I don't feel like he applies that same mentality to me. He told me yesterday he 'doesn't mean to not care', it's just that I am not on his mental list, which felt like a punch in the gut.

Today I woke up ugly crying while I tried to clean the kitchen because my body was reacting to the realisation that I don't feel I can trust him. It is hard to realise when you love the other person so much. He came out to ask what was wrong and I had to tell him, and that was heartbreaking. He is now very silent and went back to bed. I don't know how to navigate this without hurting his feelings.

He is very sensitive and I can be blunt, so for the past 6 months I have been sending my response texts to him through chat gpt first so I can ensure that I am not being rude or hurting his feelings.

I am running out of energy and I don't know what to do or how to help. I have been struggling a lot since we moved into the new house. I organised everything, the removalists, the paperwork, all of it. We have now been here for 6 weeks and we're still drowning in boxes, some of which have sat in the exact same place as before. I have been piecing away at it, and he does too occasionally, but the bulk of it is just sitting there and even when I say ""can we unpack xxx together this weekend"", it is met with a ""maybe...""

I had a breakdown yesterday because everything is so gross and nasty in the house right now, and he said ""don't worry, we have 4 weeks to sort it out"" (as in, before I come back from Europe), and its making my feel crazy because it shouldnt be too much to ask that the bathroom gets a decent clean up after he shaves everywhere. I am so stressed and anxious and need to relax, but he doesn't see why it would be nice for us to have a clean space now, and not just later.

I am going crazy. He blames it on his dyslexia, but I think a lot of it is because he actually doesn't care to make me a priority. I am really struggling and don't know what to do anymore. Can anybody help with some advice?

thank you

She(16f) confessed she wants to break up with me(18m),"She told me yesterday that she wanted to break up because of our long-distance relationship we hardly talk than we used to, and she said our conversations always felt the same.

Deep down, I think a part of me knew this might happen someday, but I still can’t fully accept the reality that we’ve broken up. It doesn’t feel real yet.

I’ve been caught up with work and school, and the 8-hour time difference between us made it really hard to find time to talk.

We never spoke in either of our native languages, which made deeper communication even more difficult. Whenever I tried to share something new like updates about my business, some struggles I was facing, or even just telling her I went out with friends she would usually respond with the same phrases like “That’s good,” “Good luck,” or “Keep going,” followed by “I love you.” It felt like a loop.

At first, I appreciated that she was trying to stay by my side and be supportive. But over time, I started feeling less motivated to open up. I felt more like a listener than someone she was actually having a conversation with. Still, her lifestyle also stayed the same, so unless she had something new to share, I couldn’t find much to say either.

I know it’s my fault for not trying harder to find topics from her lifestyle. Now, I’m just trying to accept with her decision little by little, still don’t  accept the reality tho What should I do for the next step


TL;DR: She broke up with me because our long-distance relationship wasn’t working. We barely talked, and our conversations felt repetitive. I still can’t accept the breakup and don’t know what to do next.",0,1kvi2nz,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvi2nz/she16f_confessed_she_wants_to_break_up_with_me18m/
"My FWB said ""I love you""","I've (36m) been seeing this girl (36f) for a few weeks now. At first I was catching feelings for her but had to nip that in the butt to prevent the inevitable heartbreak. 

We text everyday and often run errands together. We click together so well and our conversations seem effortless, It's like I've known her for years. She stays at my place every Saturday for drinks. Last night we had the best sex we ever had and afterwards, she said she loves me. Needless to say I was taken aback because this was what I was trying to prevent and she said it first. I froze up and just smiled back. 

I feel bad because I really like her and I want to love her but it hasn't got to that point. We're still getting to know eachother. Im pretty sure I will fall really hard for her with time if I don't learn to control my emotions and act accordingly.

I just got out of a 9 year relationship with someone that is and always has been borderline obsessed me. Now that we're not together she is getting out of hand. Always asking me to come over and  trying feel me up to the point where I feel really uncomfortable and have to leave.

I'm really vulnerable rn and I don't know how to proceed with this new girl. I don't want to break it off with her, ever tbh. She has to go back home in a month and the thought of her leaving really upsets me.

Right now I have two girls who claim to love me but I don't see a future with either of them. I'm not attracted to my ex and my FWB is quite frankly out of my league. Not even sure what she doing with me.

Should I break it off now or just enjoy the short time we have together? 
Should I tell my ex about this person to make her understand that it's really over?

TL;DR: my fwb said she loves me

"[19M] Don’t know If I’ve cheated, if she’s cheated, or what to do. I just miss her and want to text her.","I’ve been in relationship with my 19 F girlfriend for nine months now. Things were always going well between us. We met naturally in university and she fell in love with me, showering me with affection and taking care of me, and I did the same. We were each others first relationship, we’d talked to others before but nothing ever worked out. We checked each other’s phones at times, and for her, there were no guys in her phone and she was repulsed at the idea of being with another guy. 

Over the past week contact became sporadic and she blamed her lack of texting on the fact that her parents were pressuring her to find a boyfriend from the same cultural background (I’m a different race). This was due to the fact that we had discussed that we wanted to get married and saw a future in our relationship. She also said her lack of contact was due to “family issues.” We spoke three days ago and she said that she was stressed and didn’t know what to do, and did not want to break up but hated feeling pressure from her mum. I also once during the relationship was invited to her place to have dinner with her folks and everything went well, which led me to think that maybe her folks did like me after all. 

After not hearing from her for another 2-3 days I was sent a photo of her with another guy. She had her fingers on the side of his face. My heart dropped, and in the next days I spoke with her about it to which she said that the reason she drove to see him was because he was a family friend and she had errands to run in that area anyway. She also repeatedly said that when they hung out it was purely platonic and the photo of them together did not have any significance and that she was actually uncomfortable with him taking photos of her. She also stated that she was playing with his younger siblings and him and scratched something off his face. He happened to also be the same race as her. I don’t think she’s the type to cheat but I never can know. 

That being said, her friends have told me she didn’t know if we had broken up or not when this incident occurred. Because she told me she needed space beforehand, and that to her meant that we were over. But to me, I just thought that it meant that she needed some
time to sort out family issues. She apologised and feels remorse for her actions, at least it seems, but I can’t stop thinking about her and what could’ve been. 

We even had each others life 360’s and she would always message me. whenever she didn’t message me she’d say that it was because she was with her family. I know this was true, as Her snap score didn’t go up and her instagram followers/following didn’t change (I didn’t religiously check these things but did from time to time).

I do also want to clarify that after I found out about this incident that happened I also wanted to come clean about something I had done during the relationship. I had invited a female coworker (friend) over to my house to have a conversation and catch up. this was not a date or planned out in advance. I also did not know that she had feelings for me. However, towards the end of the interaction, when she told me she had feelings and wanted to hang out again I immediately shut it down, as I am not a cheater. however I told my girlfriend as I felt like I made a mistake by hiding this interaction from her in the first place, although it was nothing that crossed any boundaries we had set. 


I’ve asked her friends how’s she’s doing to which they say she’s okay, struggled (was crying) in the first couple days but is okay. I still miss her more than anything, can’t eat, sleep, or function the same. I workout and train jiu jitsu and work on my business to distract myself but I truly cannot live. I have this constant pit in my stomach and am socially off since this incident occurred. I’ve never had any mental or physical health problems before but I had my first proper panic attack when this news was delivered to me and haven’t been the same since. 

We did so much for each other, between spending time, facetimes, caring about each other, bringing each other food, taking care of each other’s families. I do believe she really did love me as much as I did her but this is making me go insane and question everything. 


Most recently, she told me that she still has feelings for me but she needs to find someone of her own cultural background to fulfill the “obligation she has to her parents.”

Was this cheating on my end and hers and is my relationship done? and if so, how can I walk away and get over her? 

TL;DR — not sure if my girlfriend has cheated on me and trying to find out what to do. I also don’t know how to feel about what I’ve done, and how to get over the “breakup.”

I (19F) feel like I’m a terrible girlfriend to my boyfriend (18M) and I don’t know what to do anymore,"We have been together for 8 months and known each other for a year 

I don’t even know where to start honestly. I feel like I’m just a shitty person to be with. I’m always on edge, always angry, and we fight almost every day. Even after small arguments, I’ll suggest a break or something dramatic like that. I don’t know why I do it.

We were in long distance for like 2 weeks and fought every single day for hours. I can’t stop myself from always wanting to be right, even when I know I’m wrong. My anger just takes over and I hate it. Sometimes I can control it, but most of the time I just let it all out.

I’ve never really felt the urge to live either. I just exist because I have to. It’s not like I haven’t tried to change — I have, multiple times. But it always goes back to the same cycle. I think a lot of this comes from childhood trauma and being messed up for so long, but I don’t have money or resources for help.

 We just keep going back and forth, fighting and then making up. He doesn’t deserve this and I don’t know how to fix it. I’m just so fucking tired of myself.

I wish I knew how to stop being this angry, irritated, and defensive all the time. I feel like I’m ruining everything.
Any advice, even tough love, would be appreciated.

TL;DR: I am always angry, fighting with my boyfriend, and I feel like a shitty person to be with. We fought every day during long distance and I keep falling into the same toxic loops. I think it stems from childhood trauma but I have no resources for help. I feel exhausted and don’t know how to stop being this way before I mess it all up.

I (25f) want to be more than FWB with this guy (27m).,"I’m (25f) FWB with this guy (27m) for a little over a month. I’ve known him for about a year and a half. He’s my friend’s brother who I met through her. I was instantly attracted to him the night we met and I know he was into me. But about two years ago his fiancé admitted she was cheating on him and left him for the other guy. So he’s really nervous about getting into a relationship.

He and I finally hooked up like I said like a month ago and we’ve hooked up five times since. It’s great. The sex is great. I have absolutely no complaints about that at all.

But I feel like I really just want more with him. And sometimes I think he wants us to be more too. He’ll send me random texts sometimes about how he thinks I’m beautiful. He’s really attentive, he makes me laugh. He’s really thoughtful. For instance he called me on Friday and asked if he could take me to the art museum because he saw an artist I like has an exhibition there. Now, he’s not into art. And I think I may have mentioned this artist once to him in passing. But he remembered and is going to take me to see the exhibition on Tuesday. Like, I know afterwards we’ll probably go back to his place and hook up but I don’t get the feeling that’s why he’s doing it. 

I enjoy the sex with him. But I feel also that I have so much more to offer to him. I think we could make each other really happy. I just want him to give it a chance. I know he got hurt. But that was someone else that did it. I want to tell him all of this. I want him to know how great I think he is. 

I want to tell him Tuesday. If he feels differently I know it may change things and maybe he’ll say we can’t be FWB anymore. But maybe he’ll say he feels the same?  Should I just tell him? I’ve never really been in a situation like this before and I’m hoping someone else out there who has will have some advice for me.

How can I hide my social life from my partner?,"I (33F) am currently in a 10 year long life partnership and my partner (41M) has recently made me aware that he struggles with the amount of time I spend with my friends. He doesn't have a social life outside of me, not even at work since he mans the store he works at by himself, so he gets a little jealous of me when I go out to eat with friends or stay at a friend's house to go to a local music festival or even when I'm on the phone with friends since it's something he doesn't do and because it takes time away from him. I guess he's been struggling with it for a while, mostly when his old friends started to move away or start families or advance their careers so they couldn't just hangout whenever they wanted anymore.

I don't want him to feel left out or like I'm ignoring him so I'm looking for advice and ideas on how to hide my social activities from him. So far I've got saying I'm doing volunteer work, going on generic errands, and going to doctor appointments, but I'd like to diversify those options so they don't repeat too much. I'll also have to mostly do social outings when I'm off from work, but he's working so it doesn't take too much time away from him, but that's not always possible so I have to think of really good and believable things I'm doing while he's home so he doesn't get upset or jealous while I'm out.

Additionally, I've taken to paying a friend of mine to take him out to eat or take him to the comic book shop every once in a while so he has someone to talk to about his hobbies and hangout with and that seems to help him feel more fulfilled. I'm hoping it keeps working and my friend doesn't get tired of it, even after compensation.

HELP- gf and I broke up and I want her back. Unsure how to work towards it,"TLDR: GF (27F) and I (25M) agreed it was best for us to break up, and now I feel it was a huge mistake. I hurt her feelings really badly and it completely changed the dynamic of our relationship. I want her back so badly.

So my ex-gf and I got into a relationship last year April pretty much straight after Valentine’s Day - cliche I know. As you’d expect the honeymoon stage was great, loads of sex, plenty of late night laughs, I’m sure you guys know how it goes.

A couple months down the line we plan our first holiday together to go island hopping in Greece. We were both aware that not only did we have different personalities, we also just saw life differently and handled it in different ways e.g. one was more organised, the other was more go with the flow etc.

This first holiday of ours turned out to be a nightmare for the most part, we couldn’t seem to agree on anything, arguing all the time due to a lack of organisation etc. Somehow towards the end of the one week we manage to make peace and it’s all good from there. When we come back home to London, things became so much better - I think we realised that that was our first big hurdle that we managed to get through. I remember taking her hand and saying “this is not what’s going to make or break us”. She trusted me, we flipped the script and made it work.

Fast forward a couple months to October and this is where everything goes downhill. We were both at my place and for the whatever reason we start talking about America - somewhere that’s always been a dream of mine to live in. We were high off weed and she asks me: “If you had a really good job opportunity to live there, would you leave me and go?” - without any hesitation I say yes. Now why did I do that you ask? Because it felt like the honest thing to say at the time.

Between the months of October and April, things just aren’t easy as you’d expect them not to be. The relationship seems to slowly be fizzling out and we’re both trying our best but nothing seems to be working. Towards the end of April she calls it - “I think we should break up.” and I don’t even try and negotiate, I simply agree and think that it’s for the best considering we don’t seem compatible for the future because of things such as where to settle down, when to raise a family etc.

Fast forward a month and obviously we’re still broken up. Do I regret? Oh boy do I regret it. Why did I just accept the end of the relationship? I wouldn’t say we gave up on it because we were working on it for months.

However, now it seems my eyes have finally opened up. I feel like I’ve given up on something that I knew I had, which made me happy, for something that isn’t even set in stone and may never even happen. I called her a couple days ago and said I want her back. I said I had time to reflect and how I know what she needs from me in the relationship and that I’m willing to give it to her alongside finding some sort of compromise as that’s what relationships are all about - she said it was a lot to take in and she’ll need a couple days to think about what I said.

I don’t know what to do - I just know I don’t want to live in regret and see her as the one who got away.

We both still have love for each other and I’m definitely still in love with her. How do I win her back? I feel like this is my final shot.",1,1kvh54w,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvh54w/help_gf_and_i_broke_up_and_i_want_her_back_unsure/
Blindsided by my (29F) boyfriend's (29M) critique of my cleanliness. Need help/advice,"Hi there! My (29F) boyfriend (29M) have been together for about 2 years. We moved in together 6 months ago (into the house that my boyfriend owns) and I thought things were going relatively well. We don't tend to have any real communication snags, which now makes perfect sense. Apparently my boyfriend has been bottling up his frustration/resentment about the cleanliness of the house and decided to unleash all of it on me today.

Additional background: my boyfriend I'm being honest, is a bit of a slob. I knew this about him when I met him and it didn't bother me because many, many people close to me in my family and otherwise are also slobs. Running around like a little gremlin and cleaning the occasional tornados people leave behind is truly just part of being in a functional household to me. Nothing ever gets too messy, and if it does, you all pitch in and clean it together. I would consider myself a relatively organized/routine person, but very laid back. As you can imagine, I had multiple conversations with my boyfriend about our cleaning styles and our expectations for living together so we wouldn't have the very issue we're having now.

The house is MUCH cleaner than it was when my boyfriend was living here by himself but, according to him, I'm not doing enough. He spent over an hour telling me about all of the little things I'm not doing correctly (i.e. sometimes I'll forget to move an empty soda can into the recycling bin before I go to sleep for the night, or I'll do all the dishes and forget to clean the pot that's on the stove) and how it frustrates him and stresses him.

I told him I can be more mindful, but the truth is that all of these things he was so upset with me about were minor mistakes/slip ups that people just make from time to time. (I clean every day, and any room we use on a regular basis is maintained on a schedule that I keep). His accusations also seemed kind of hypocritical because he does almost no cleaning. Like borderline zero. I told him he can pitch in and help, to which he said he does and that's why he's so frustrated and exhausted. (Reddit, I'm not crazy. I know there can be a misperception of what you're doing vs. what someone else is doing to keep things clean, but I am 100% confident that I am doing 90% of the cleaning -- which I don't mind! I agreed to do a lot of cleaning because I enjoy it more!)

The other issue is that there are projects that my boyfriend will start up and not finish and I guess he's been expecting me to clean those as well? (He did not communicate this to me until now, and I guess maybe it's on me for not asking, but I try to respect his space by not messing with the projects he has going).

Anyway, I'm on Reddit because my boyfriend is genuinely fuming about this. I think this is honestly the most angry I've ever seen him. But I don't understand what to do. I don't want to be walking around on eggshells, worrying about every little thing, when that's not how he treats the house at all. Yeah, sure, it gets a little messy over the course of the day (can you take a guess why), but then it just...gets cleaned. I know he has ADHD, and that also makes organization and cleanliness tough, but this situation just seems really unfair to me. I really do keep the place tidy and clean up after myself, but things are constantly accumulating throughout the day.

Is there anything that I've written that points to an issue/attitude/communication problem I have that needs to be adjusted? How can I create a working system where we both live and clean comfortably in a way that leaves both of us feeling happy? It's almost like my boyfriend has decided he wants everything perfectly organized but isn't willing to put in the work to make it that way. I love our house, and I love being here with him, and I'm just heartbroken to learn he's been so secretly unhappy all these months.

TLDR: My (29F) boyfriend (29M) is totally ticked about our home's cleanliness and I don't know what to do. I say 'blindsided' in my title because he has not mentioned anything like this until now.

I need advice!!,"I 19(M) is currently in a situation with my (18) gf. For short context we have been together for about 4 going on 5 months now. I'm currently in a situation where my gf was invited to her friend's Airbnb. Not big on the party stuff out of respect for her, but it's her friend and I don't wanna be that controlling bf. We have had numerous conversations about communication while being in that type of setting in which she failed to do so this weekend. This was a 2 night even in which she stayed the night saturday night. I wasn't too pushy Friday night, as she was reassuring me, but came to find out that all communication stopped after she ""fell asleep"". It just doesn't add up how you fall asleep at a friend's event but ok cool. Saturday morning, we talk and she apologizes and says she will communicate better which is all I ask of her to do.

Come Saturday night, I feel like our conversation has completely gone out the window, as she confirmed she was up but gone hours without a text nor some type of reassurance. I'm sure this all ties down into my trust in her, but it genuinely got worse. Sunday morning she wakes me up still a bit drunk/ hungover from last night telling me she's sorry and what not, which I'm honestly not buying because yesterday was her prime chance to show me your sorry for Friday night prior. Before I hung up I caught that she called me another guy's name who ended up being at the Airbnb. I did a bit of digging and he is my gf's friend's friend. Now I end up calling back which I regret now but it just gets worse. She's now in the room with the rest of her friends having a girl talk but it's like she completely forgot I existed and was on the phone.

I feel like by now I know my gfs voice and can point out when she's talking vs when she's not. I went on mute and wrote down everything I heard. 1 My gf had they guys hoodie on, so they were together at some point that night. 2, I vividly heard her say she cheats on me, and I'm going to continue to talk to her which absolutely blew my mind. 3 I overheard her say to a friend ""how did you get caught cheating"" which in my head implies she does it and I haven't caught on. So all this alone just makes me feel like she doesn't even respect me nor love me because how could you possibly act or say that with friends. To add on, her and I had a conversation a while ago, and she said out of her mouth that her best friend is the grimiest girl she knows. So who am I to think shes not doing the same. Birds of a feather flock together. Now if I'm gonna be honest there is way more to this situation but all this alone gives me the ok to just leave and disappear. But I'm still hurt and I want to hear her side. I feel like this is completely stupid because what could she say to get herself out of this situation other than play victim or flip this situation on me.

To top this whole thing off, after she got home, I asked if we could talk in person in which she agreed. I watched with my own eyes her location drops a friend off passing my house and go back home in which I haven't heard from her since at the time of writing this. I truly don't understand how you leave your house to drop a friend home then end up back home. I'm sure she's sleeping because I haven't heard from her in hours. I honestly don’t know what to do right now and I feel like I'm stuck, well at least my heart is.

TL:DR: Gf attended a Airbnb and having doubts along with a bit of proof she cheated. My heart hurst and I don't know what move to make next",0,1kvfu3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvfu3y/i_need_advice/
"My bf (M21) does activities I (F21) like with his brother (M22), but not with me","Hi everyone! So, I (F21) have been dating my boyfriend (M21) for about six months now. We're having a good relationship overall, but there's something that really bothers me.

I’ve asked and encouraged him to do activities that I’m really interested in so we can spend more time together and I can share my hobbies with him. These activities include things like running, biking, walking, and artsy stuff. He’s more of a gym guy and plays chess—things I was somewhat into when we started dating (I was working out a bit and just starting my chess journey, lol).

When we began dating, it felt natural for me to get into his hobbies and participate in them to spend time with him. But when I tried to get him into mine, he always seemed to have an excuse. In the past six months, he’s gone running with me only once—even though I trained with him about three times a week.

A month ago, I was practically begging him to go outside for a walk with me on the weekend so we could get some fresh air. He said he was too busy and didn’t feel like it. Later that same week, he texted me to say he was going on a walk—with his brother (M22). Honestly, I felt hurt and a bit betrayed. I let it slide, but nothing changed. He kept going on walks with his brother, but not with me, even when we were spending weekends together. Eventually, I told him I was frustrated. I explained that I was making an effort to be involved in his interests, but it didn’t feel mutual. I think he understood.

Then, this weekend, I finally convinced him to come running with me—but he got sick, so we didn’t go. I went home, and later he told me he ended up going on a run with his brother anyway—and that he had a better running time than I’ve had lately.

I know it’s not a competition, but I couldn’t help feeling a bit butthurt. Running is something I really enjoy, and now he’s not only doing it without me, but he's also outperforming me at it. It’s silly, but sometimes it's nice to feel like you’re better at something than your partner, and vice versa. Now I’m left wondering—what do I even have that’s mine in this relationship?

But more than that, it’s the fact that he keeps choosing to do these things with his brother, but not with me. I feel jealous and mad, and I know it might seem irrational, but… is it? Is this kind of behavior normal? And is it normal to feel jealous about this sort of thing?

Anyway, thanks for reading, haha!

TL;DR : I've been dating my boyfriend, Jay, for six months, and while our relationship is generally good, I'm frustrated that he won't engage in my hobbies (like running or walking) even though I've made an effort to join in his (like gym workouts and chess). He often makes excuses to avoid doing things I enjoy, yet does those same activities—like walking or running—with his brother instead. This makes me feel hurt, jealous, and unappreciated. I’ve brought it up, and he seemed to understand, but nothing has changed. I'm struggling with whether my feelings are valid and if this behavior is normal in a relationship.

the dynamic has shifted in my relationship,"TLDR; I used to feel secure in my relationship, but now I’m anxious, clingy, and constantly need reassurance. I compared myself to his ex and girls he used to message. His mum also made a hurtful comment. I want to go back to feeling confident and independent

my bf and i have known eachother/going on dates since 29 september 2024. we became official in january 2025. we met on hinge. he’s always been so obsessed and in love with me sometimes saying i can’t believe your my gf sometimes. at the start till about a few weeks ago i was so secure and in love with him but not as affectionate as he was i still loved my alone time he wanted to see me more than i did in my head etc. now i feel so insecure all of a sudden i feel like im not good enough and ive been so anxious and i always want him around and want to cuddle and im scared hes wanting to leave me. today he said he felt a bit like we were walking in eggshells around me cos i get sensitive and keep asking whether he loves me. wha am i doing how do i go back to not needing him this much and being independent and not being afraid he doesn’t love me or will cheat etc 

a few things that have affected this is i went through his phone and saw that he was messaging a lot of blonde aesthetic girls (beach carefree bikini type feed) before me. (big mistake by me). his ex came up on my depop when i was searching for a dress and she’s got an amazing body that’s better than mine and i keep thinking how he’s slept with her and probably comparing my body to hers. he also said to me i like that you’re not super skinny. but im a size 6 au and people have always called me skinny and he kept saying not but being skinny is not good you’re a healthy weight which is what i love. and then i was comparing my body to his ex in my head because she is model thin. 

further to this, a few weeks ago his mum got drunk and questioned whether i fit in well to the family culturally and made comments to exclude meat a family trip. my boyfriend fully took my side in this, set his mum straight/said he won’t tolerate comments like that and she apologised to me (sincerely). but that also made me feel so shit about myself like i’m not good enough. 

how to shift the dynamic back to when i wasn’t insecure, clingy, requiring his affection and constant reassurance etc? this whole week ive kept asking him whether he loves me and if im even his type. he knows i went through his phone and saw the blonde girls and he said he keeps saying im his type and he loves me and he shows this in other ways also. i hate myself right now for being like this so please be nice.

It all started happening a few months ago, I jokingly said that I am so doing this job...need to leave this job, I don't feel like working anymore...and bla. I thought he'd laugh and say that its fine and that i can do however I like. BUT, he got all flustered up and said NO, do not stop working. I did not think of it too much that time. Similiar thing happend a few weeks later, when he, his family and I were at dinner at one of the relative's house and they (relative) suggested that i should stop working for a while and focus on my health and myself a bit (we are trying for a baby and there have been a few complications). His mother jumped in and said loud ""NO NO NO there isnt any reason for you to stop working."" I know there isnt any reason but the way she said it was weird.   
After that, I have brought this subject up a few times in conversations and my husband never once supported the idea. i am so confused... i always thought that it was my choice to work.

There are definitely great aspects to our relationship, and I do see potential — but there are also serious issues that leave me stuck between my future and this relationship.

When we first got together, I used to hit the gym 4–5 times a week, especially during weekend nights with friends — it was an important part of my lifestyle. Since we became a couple, we’ve been spending almost every weekend together from Friday evening to Sunday night, and also a few evenings during the week. While I do enjoy our time together, we mostly just hang out, watch Netflix, go for walks — not really anything productive. The problem is, I also study, have to work, and I have a business project with a friend, and I want to keep up with the gym and start Muay Thai — I have goals I want to pursue while I’m young and have time.

When I try to talk to her about needing more time for myself and my goals, she takes it personally. She interprets it as me not loving her enough, not making her a priority, or wanting to see her less. She says she also has to study and work but still makes time for me, so I should be able to do the same. She has very high expectations of emotional presence — like wanting her partner to only have eyes for her and treat other women very distantly.

I want to emphasize that I’ve tried to communicate this with her — multiple times. I’ve explained that I need time for myself, not just for work or productivity, but because I function better when I have space to recharge and focus on what matters to me. Alone time is important for my well-being, but every time I try to express this, it ends in her feeling hurt or rejected. She takes it as a sign that I don’t care about her enough, rather than understanding that this is something I genuinely need. So while some people might say “just talk it through and find a compromise,” I feel like I’ve already done that — and it hasn’t worked. She sees my needs as a threat rather than something we could balance together.

There’s also a deep trust issue. Her last boyfriend betrayed her trust (flirting with other girls, keeping nudes, etc.), and I’ve made mistakes too. Most recently, she found that I had viewed some stupid thirst trap content on TikTok — nothing I saved or interacted with, just watched. But it triggered a big fight, and I fully understand why. I apologized, deleted TikTok, and acknowledged it as a moment of weakness and lack of dicipline I'm working on. But it really hurt her and worsened the trust issues that were already there.

She also gets upset over things that seem harmless to me. For example, one time I bought flowers for my mother’s birthday, and before heading into the gym, I asked a female staff member at the gym front desk (she was the only person there) if she could hold them for me during my workout, since they’d get damaged in my locker. My girlfriend was with me at the time, and afterwards, she was really upset — saying I was too nice to the staff member and that a “real man” shouldn’t speak so kindly to other women. From my perspective, it was just a practical and polite interaction — nothing more.

I’m not even saying I need to be friends with other girls — that’s not what I’m after. I don’t feel the need for female friends. But at the very least, just being able to communicate normally, socialize, and maybe build connections if there is any value or so like a normal person — simply because it’s always valuable to know people and improve your social skills — is already a huge issue for her. In her eyes, like I mentioned, a man shouldn’t even be kind to another woman. To her, things like simply talking to other women or being friendly already feel like a form of cheating — because in her eyes, a truly loyal man only has eyes for her, ignores other girls completely, and would never initiate any kind of interaction with them, as that would already cross a boundary of trust.

She often questions whether I’m really out with my friends and asks me to send proof. It’s exhausting. And while I’ve made my mistakes and try to take accountability, the trust issues have been there from the start and seem to be growing, not healing.

Right now, I feel stuck between two paths. Part of me wants to hold on and try to fix things. But the other part wonders if I’m already giving up too much of myself just to maintain this relationship — and whether that’s something I’ll regret later. I’m trying to figure out what’s truly right for me long-term.

TL;DR:
I’m 20 and in a one-year relationship with someone I care about, but I’m stuck between growing as a person and keeping the relationship going. I’ve already communicated that I need time and space to focus on studying, the gym, and building a self-employment project — but my girlfriend takes that as rejection. Trust issues, emotional pressure, and control are wearing me down. I’m unsure whether to keep pushing or choose myself.

I (27F) self-sabotaged my relationship with my boyfriend (30M) due to depression and imposter syndrome. Is it too late to fix it?,"
Hello everyone, I’m asking for kindness and non-judgmental advice and opinions as I’m going through a very difficult time in my life. I feel burnt out with life and I (27F) have self-sabotaged my first-ever loving relationship with my boyfriend (30M). For backstory, we met and dated during the pandemic. I was a non-traditional community college student about to transfer and he was a military sergeant who was thinking of pursuing college for the first time in order to become an officer. We fell in love and with some encouragement he applied to community college and I transferred. We lived 10 min from each other for a year and then 30 min from each other for 2 years. Although there are many precious memories, our arguments have reached a limit to him and I’m afraid there’s no turning back as much as I’m trying to fix it.

I think it all started when it was his turn to transfer and he was applying to a local university. I saw the potential in him and encouraged him to apply to the local private university that is known as one of the best in the country. He was hesitant yet he applied 2 weeks prior to the deadline. When he got accepted to the private university, I cried tears of joy. I was so very proud of him! However, I didn’t expect him to be loaded in work. Now he had military officer training (rotc), 20 units per quarter in order to graduate within 2 years, and tons of reading and essays. Meanwhile, I was finishing my last year of public university with school-related stress and severe imposter syndrome because I had tried for 3 years to obtain a major-related internship and failed.

After I graduated in May 2024, my imposter syndrome got worse because I obtained a seasonal position I didn’t really want. Then, I was coming to a realization that my boyfriend’s college career was working out so well for him. This is when I first started feeling a bit jealous of my boyfriend. In the past year, he got accepted as an officer which means that will be his title/ranking in the military once he’s active after his graduation. This meant a year away from home to train and I was ok with that. I started planning out goals to achieve during our year away from each other so when I move in with him, I can be financially and mentally independent. But nothing in my life has worked out how I wanted it to.

• I moved back in with my parents which meant we were 2 hrs away from each other.

• I only worked for 2 months as a seasonal employee. My job search has led to a few interviews. I’ve been forced to accept job rejections and ghosting. I have tailored my resume multiple times with chatgpt and wrote cover letters for the positions I was really interested in. 

• A month ago, my 15 yo childhood dog started suffering epilepsy and had to be put down. Seeing my dog have a 10 min seizure was extremely traumatic. 

• 2 months ago, my homeless uncle, aunt, and aunt’s husband moved into our home. A family of 4 is now 7 in a 3 bed/2 bath home. We’re all adults and I gave up my room so my aunt and her husband could sleep in it. To say I’m overwhelmed is an understatement. I have no privacy and my aunt is a highly opinionated woman and having to hear her voice everyday annoys me because I disagree with lots of things she says yet I have to remain composed and apathetic because I don’t want to make her feel disrespected.

I’ve only hung out with my boyfriend for 2-3 weekends this year and the last 2 weekends were messy and unhealthy that I don’t really remember most of the arguments. The first weekend I recall feeling sad because he was not giving me enough attention but that was the norm because he was always busy with school. What triggered me was seeing a matching bracelet I gave him. I had mine on but his was on a shelf and that killed me emotionally. I didn’t say anything and went into his apartment bathroom to cry on the floor. After an hour of crying, I kept thinking to myself “Why isn’t he coming for me? Why am I torturing myself?”. I had enough and went into the small living room and cried. I was still ignored for hours. After about 3 hours of just crying on the floor, I started hitting myself and saying things like “you don’t love me”. I ripped the matching bracelet off of me. He obviously reacted but didn’t hug me. He told me to relax and we talked while I cried and then I told him to hug me. He told me to play a game on my iPad and then we went to bed cuddling and had sex. The next day it was as if nothing had happened.

The second weekend we hung out, I didn’t feel like cooking with him which is usually what we do. I felt tired of my life and was only thinking of jobs and career future. I do remember opening up about being so worried that my plans weren’t working out and how traumatic this job search has been. I felt like not owning a car and having all my savings decrease overtime made me feel like a worthless girlfriend. What do I have to offer when we move in together? The next day, I don’t remember what he said but I started packing up my stuff crying. I told him I wasn’t feeling good and that it would be best if I leave. We then sat down and he started getting a bit upset that in the past 2 years I always run away during an argument or over something he says. He had told me he was walking on egg shells and I told him the same. I was running away but letting him know for the first time ever which was kind of hard to do. Looking back, it’s a bit of growth to even be a bit open in communication instead of being silently dramatic when running away. I didn’t leave and the next day we went on a beautiful hike and had lunch. This was 5 weeks ago. 

Coming back home, I realized that I’m not ok. I felt on the verge of burnout. My self-esteem was at its lowest and I couldn’t recognize myself anymore. Nothing brings me joy. I decided to seek therapy because I was done feeling overwhelmed with life. I was jealous of my boyfriend’s life and tired of not being able to regulate my emotions. I knew this was depression. Eventually, I broke down at home because I was rejected from the 2 positions I had interviewed at. I wasted an entire month just interviewing with those companies and carrying false hope. Breaking down for me is ugly. So much self-loathing sentiments and the urge to simply die but being unable to. A huge wave of negative thoughts I’ve been telling myself about everything including my relationship overtook me and I blew it later that night (Mother’s Day weekend). He FaceTimes me and in the recent months, our conversations have been about his upcoming graduation. With attitude, I let him know that it’s best if he gives away my graduation ticket to someone else in his family because they will enjoy and celebrate him more than I ever will. He asked “What did you say?” And I said “You know what I said”. He sternly smiled and said ok. We hung up and I went to sleep with deep shame. I had my first therapy session the next day and the connection wasn’t there which was frustrating. I realized I regretted hurting my boyfriend and that what I truly needed was a psychiatrist. I meet her this Wednesday. Anyways, my boyfriend still texted me and I kindly said I wasn’t feeling well and that I would text him another day. He told me that was ok and to feel better. It took me 4 days to calm down and during those 4 days I finally opened up to my mom about what was going on with me. I cried because I had negative 10 dollars in my bank account all because my ego didn’t allow me to work a regular retail/fast food job. I felt a bit better once I made my psych appointment because I wanted to change for the better. I’m tired of hurting the people that love me the most. After 4 days, I texted him what was up and he ignored me. After a few messages he tells me he had the roughest weekend ever, that I wouldn’t understand and wants to be alone and just focus on finishing strong in order to graduate. I said I was here now and to talk to me and he refused. I called him 8 times until he picked up with attitude. I told him this is clearly a relationship issue and it’s an urgent matter that needs to be fixed. He basically said he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I cause a lot of stress and pain for him and the resentment had been building up overtime which led him not trusting me anymore. I knew all of our problems that I instigated were part of his decision but clearly the graduation ticket comment was the breaking point. I cried so much and had another mental breakdown. I opened up to my mom about all the times I’ve been so mean and spiteful to him and how he didn’t deserve any of it. 

After a few days he accepted a phone call where I apologized and let him know I was already trying to seek help and I wanted him to give us another chance. He said no as it didn’t matter anymore since he’s leaving for a year. I cried again for almost a week and I felt I was going crazy. The psych ward couldn’t have me as I didn’t have plans to you know what. I was referred to a crisis counselor that didn’t help at all.

I then chose to drive to him since I hadn’t seen him in 5 weeks. I left a care package of food and snacks that I paid with a credit card. He kindly accepted it and took me for a walk to talk. We catched up as if nothing had ever happened. Then we started talking about the care package. He said he felt so bad that I wasn’t coping well and had driven 2 hrs to see him. He wanted to give me money and I refused. He told me “you know you’re struggling”. That hurt me to the max and I apologized again about the graduation comments and anything I ever said or did. He said the resentment was there but that all was forgiven. He said he couldn’t take me back if I didn’t love myself. He said “How can you love someone else if you don’t love yourself?”. He had watery eyes throughout our conversation but I just ugly cried. I told him I was already making a huge step to fixing myself and he said no. He said he asked many times for me to change and he never saw it. He doesn’t believe I will change and my heart shattered. I had self-sabotaged my relationship. We hugged one last time and he didn’t want to kiss me so I don’t get false hope of reconciliation. 

I don’t know how I drove back home but I haven’t eaten in 2 days and my family doesn’t understand me at all. They just want me to accept and feel better. I have to hear them talk about how disrespectful I am that I’m not eating or doing anything. I’m officially burnt out and want my own space to mourn. I keep beating myself up even though he told me not to. He told me he cares a lot about me and still loves me and I lowkey feel betrayed because he has never left before when I’m out of my mind. His graduation week includes officer training graduation, his birthday, and our 4 year anniversary as well. All hopes and dreams are lost because of me and I truly regret hurting him. Why couldn’t I support him when he loved me? Does anyone have stories about reconciliation? Any advice? Thank you for reading. I’m lost and I’m very sorry this is all about me. I hope to be better.   


TL;DR: I’ve been deeply depressed and overwhelmed with life. I pushed away the person I love the most and now he says he can’t be with me anymore. He still cares, but says I need to focus and love myself first. I’ll be seeing a psychiatrist soon but he says he doesn’t want to pursue the relationship anymore. Is there any hope for reconciliation? How do I move forward when I feel like I destroyed everything?

My (20M) gf (21F) doesn’t mesh seamlessly with my family but I love them both,"Hi all, this isn’t exactly a super specific situation, but kind of an overarching thing. I love my girlfriend of 4 years, and while we have our ups and downs, I plan to be with her long term. I am very close with my family though, and it feels like a lot of the interactions between the two are strained and awkward, tbh often at the hand of my gf. I don’t blame her, my family can be difficult to read and especially for someone who is likely on the spectrum, (very high functioning), who is socially awkward, my family would be difficult to navigate. My dad has told me a few years ago that he doesn’t think she’s the ‘right fit’ for the family, which was really hard to hear and he has told me that he regrets saying it. Regardless, I still feel like there is a lack of chemistry and I’ve tried helping from both sides. Is a relationship doomed to fail if they can’t mesh well? I love them both very much and don’t want to have to have distance between the two.

TLDR: my girlfriend doesn’t have great chemistry with my family but I love them both and don’t know how to navigate the situation.",2,1kvbeyg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvbeyg/my_20m_gf_21f_doesnt_mesh_seamlessly_with_my/
I (22M) am having a issue with my gf (22F) about working,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 2 years now and have known each other for about 4. When we first started dating she didn’t have a job but we were in college so that wasn’t a huge deal. She and I got full time jobs out of college about an hour apart. She quit hers on a whim without telling me or talking it over with me. I’ve been at the same job for the last 2 year and a year ago she moved in with me. She has been getting some jobs but she will just quit because someone or something irritated her or she get a dread feeling when she has to work. We are going back to college in a couple months and she even said she doesn’t know how she is going to do there. 

Ive tried to be supportive and help her through, I pay the bill and don’t really ask her for anything other than to do chores. She is in counseling and therapy and she might have a bi-polar disorder, so I’m sure that contributes to it. Today we talked about how she didn’t want to go to her current job and she got mad and drove off somewhere. 

I’m not sure what to do, it’s a constant up and down and I can’t keep up with it. 


TL;DR: Girlfriend keeps quitting jobs and blames it on being anxious/bi-polar and I don’t know if I can keep supporting her. ",3,1kvax46,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvax46/i_22m_am_having_a_issue_with_my_gf_22f_about/
BF (M29) unsure about future together with me (F27),"Recently my boyfriend opened up about his anxiety and thoughts about the future. We were about to be intimate when he suddenly lost arousal and then started questioning himself and our relationship, which confused him. 

We've looked at houses and talked about the thought of starting a family someday. We talked about getting married, I really do want to get married and he knows this, but he's scared of what can happen in the future which could lead to us separating one day and hurting me.      

I wanted to get information about what mortgage we are able to get etc, but he just isn't ready, which is totally fair. But I'm just worried it'll never happen, same goes for getting married.                                                                                                           We've been together for almost 2,5 years and to be fair I've expressed these feelings towards him as well: how do you know he's the one? how do you know you're going to last a lifetime, when something major could happen in 5 years that's going to destroy our relationship? To be fair I think you'll never know the answers to these questions, but still so many people decide to get married and have kids and sometimes I, myself, can't wrap my head around the fact that you'll never know 100% and still make these major decisions.

It feels hypocritical for me to say this, because like I said I've had doubts as well (which I do blame on my hormones a lot of the times, it's almost always in the same phase of my menstrual cycle when I start te think a little negative about our relationship). 

I kind of just want us to be able to say that we're going to choose each other, so that we can start building a future together. But I don't really know if that's fair for me to ask.

HELP- My fiancé gets emotionally dysregulated when I take care of myself or express needs,"I (32F) have been with my fiancé (35M) for several years. We own a home together, and we’ve been through some major life events—including the unexpected and tragic death of my father, followed two months later by an abortion I felt backed into, which has been incredibly painful for me emotionally.

Lately, I’ve been struggling with something I’d really appreciate outside perspectives on:

Whenever I take steps to care for myself or express emotional needs, my fiancé becomes emotionally dysregulated. For example, recently I told him I was having a really hard night emotionally (due to something very personal and triggering for me) and that I wanted to treat myself to a night at a hotel. I said it calmly and clearly—not in anger or blame. His response? He walked away and wouldn’t make eye contact. Later, he said he felt “blindsided” and was angry that I “sprung it on him.”

That kind of thing keeps happening.

If I express that I need more affection—like a love note now and then to feel reassured—or tell him I’m hurting and just need to be heard, he often shuts down, gets overwhelmed, or accuses me of “making up fake narratives.”

When I try to explain how I feel, he either denies it, flips it around, or spirals into a state where I end up comforting him for not being able to be there for me. It’s emotionally exhausting.

I’ve started to notice a pattern:
I express a need → he shuts down or gets upset → I feel dismissed and emotionally neglected → I question myself for having the need at all.
It’s killing my self-esteem, and I’ve started to shrink just to avoid triggering his dysregulation.

We’ve done couples counseling, and I’ve tried communicating in softer ways. He says he’s trying, and sometimes he is. But the recurring pattern is making me wonder: is this something that can change, or is it a fundamental incompatibility?

I don’t want to end things right now. In fact, I’ve taken some space (temporarily living in a short-term rental nearby) so we both have room to reflect. But I’m at a loss.

TL;DR:
My fiancé gets emotionally dysregulated when I express emotional needs or take care of myself, and I end up feeling neglected and silenced. Is this something that can change, or is it a sign of emotional incompatibility? Any thoughtful advice would mean a lot.

I [27 M] left my g/f [30 F] because she doesn’t want to fully commit to the relationship.,"Hi redditors,

Two days ago I took initiative to have a brutally honest conversation with my (now ex) girlfriend that I have been in a relationship with for 9 months, because I felt she was not fully willing to commit to the relationship. 

When we started the relationship she had doubts she would be able to fulfill my needs and expectations, but we gave it a shot anyways. 

However, my patience was over and realized this relationship is a dead end if it continues this way - so I opened up the conversation to discuss if we are on the same page.

What it came down to is that she is not in the ‘right place’ to give me what I need from the relationship, has ‘stuff to work on’ before she can make someone else happy and the fact that she couldn’t get herself to make the relationship work will be one of her ‘biggest regrets’ in life. These were her own words. Pretty heavy stuff.

So I decided to end it, because I believe that both parties in a relationship should be committed, be courageous enough to be vulnerable enough to give and receive - and there has been nothing more frustrating to me than wondering if I will ever get the same commitment back from her.

Even though I’m pretty confident in this decision, how hard and painful it might be, I can’t help but wonder if I made a mistake by leaving her, and should give her more time, but being ready to risk the fact that her readiness to commit might never change? I love her. And it’s rare to find someone you truly love. Maybe more time and patience and frustration is the price I have to pay?

TLDR; left girlfriend because she couldn’t commit due her not being in the ‘right place’ in the relationship, ‘personal issues’ she has to work on but yet deeply regrets not being able to make the relationship work. Did I make the right decision, or should I keep committing and being ready to risk the fact that she might never be ready to commit to me?",0,1kvaicf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kvaicf/i_27_m_left_my_gf_30_f_because_she_doesnt_want_to/
Drug usage by partner,"TLDR: boyfriend using coke on weekend, i am anti-drug. Keeps happening, I tell him how I feel, he apologizes, does it again.


UPDATE: hi everyone, I appreciate all your responses. They’ve made me ask myself some hard questions about what I’m willing to put up with. My partner and I had a long talk last night, tears were shed. He says he hates living this way, he feels as though he’s always working, drunk and and on drugs, or hungover. I told him my concerns for he’s mental health, physical health, career, and our relationship. I told him it’s all on the line right now. He told me he’s going to change, starting with leaving the bar when I do (usually midnight) and coming home with me. 
Also, the two of us are moving to a remote northern community for work this summer. Very isolated, little to do, one bar. He says he’s going to go sober there from both alcohol and drugs, and focus on work. I told him if he can’t do this, then I’m gone. 
I know a lot of you are urging me to end this, but I’m not ready to walk away yet. Hoping he can change, but we will see.

————————————————————————————-

Hi everyone. I’m posting here because I feel as though I have no one to talk to about this, and I’m feeling desperate. I (F29) have been with my partner (M27) for 2.5 years. We live together, work together, and made a big move together to another part of the country last year for our careers. We share a pet together, too. When I met my partner, he was sober. About 1 month into seeing him, he told me he had gone sober for abit because he was drinking and using cocaine too much. I understood this, and respected his decision to be sober. A couple months into dating, he got back into drinking, but didn’t touch drugs again. I didn’t mind this, as I love having a couple beer, and was happy to experience that with him. In the last 6-8 months, his drug use has started again. Picture this: we go out to the bar together, I stay until midnight or 1am. I go home because I’m tired. I have no problem with him staying later than me, I know he’s faithful. In the last 6-8 months, he comes home at 6am, 7am, 8am, after staying at the bars til close and then going to a friends house after to use cocaine. I ask him about it in the morning, and he admits to using coke, tells me he feels ashamed, and sorry. I tell him I want him to stop, and he says he feels like he can’t because he drinks so much that he gets to the point that he should go home, so takes Coke to sober up and stay out later. This happened again last night. We had a party for the two of us to celebrate an event in our careers. I went home at 12am (I’m simply not a party animal anymore) he said he’d stay out a bit later, I said okay. I woke up at 4am and he still wasn’t home, and I checked his location. He was at a friends house a few miles away. I texted him, he said he was there with a crew for after. He then came home at 8am and slept in the guest room. I told him I want to talk about this later today. I don’t know what to do. I love this man so much. We share a life together, have plans for the future, are each others best friends. At the party itself last night while I was still there, we were dancing around and singing, he was hugging me and telling me how much he loves me, and I feel the same way. I have no one to talk to about this because I’m humiliated that at his age, in his profession, he’s using cocaine on the weekends. This would have devastating, career-ending, profession-ending, repercussions if he were ever caught using coke. Worse, I stay up all night worrying about him getting a bad batch of coke and overdosing or being poisoned by fentanyl. I really think he has a substance abuse problem, and I don’t know what to do. Please help, thank you",2,1kv9p8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kv9p8h/drug_usage_by_partner/
Is it normal having feelings for someone other than my partner ?,"I (F23) have been with my bf for almost two years and everything’s great. We started having some small issues that made the both of us worried about our futures . I have a coworker (M21) who I’ve gotten closer to the past couple weeks and can’t seem to shake off the feelings that I feel something more than just friends. He knows abt him since we all worked together at one point but my bf (M27) doesn’t work at my job anymore. I tried to ignore the feelings and brush it off but we talk very often and we both said we talk to eachother more than anyone— to me it still seems platonic from his side but I can’t stop thinking abt him. Some of my friends say that I should just end it with my partner if I’m thinking this way but it seems so harsh bc I still love him and adore him, everything that we have I can’t forget because of how great our relationship is. Ppl envy our relationship bc of how easy and smooth it is —Should I just wait for the feelings to pass, address it , break up ? he’s a great boyfriend , he loves me wants to provide for me, wants to be better for me and I acknowledge it but this other guy — we get each others trauma, our cultures, we get eachother. I haven’t done anything but is it normal bc I feel rly guilty for feeling like I’m feeling this way behind my amazing boyfriends back

My boyfriend is unstable.,"Hi, I'm an F (17) and my boyfriend M (18) We've been dating for almost 1 year, I know I feel ridiculous  He and I were doing well for a while, but he started outbreaks of him That he is unmotivated, that his life does not go forward and these other complaints. our relationship is very good but you know those people who do not stop to look at themselves? my boyfriend is basically this he is very insecure had a difficult childhood but this does not justify every time I complain or something not he blames himself and isolates himself. I had to talk to him several times because I've had these outbreaks 3 times.

 And I had to be patient these 3 times it's not fair to me either to wait for his goodwill, he was always very patient, affectionate, loving, caring. But now it feels like I'm with a stranger, I'm losing interest every time he does it, he wanted him to fight for it but he runs away, he runs away like a mouse. I'm his first girlfriend. And instead of solving it, he simply prefers the easiest.

 I really need advice, I don't want to let it go but it's not fair to me to stay that way, this whole discussion started because I wanted it to be my equal safe haven I'm his, he gave me the certainty that it wouldn't end for at the end of the day he asked for exactly that made the decision alone without caring about me. 

I used a translator, sorry if it's bad. 

 1-Update: He said he will tell you the ""reason for termination"" tomorrow. I hope everything goes well. I really want to talk to him and really understand what's going on.

Is not inviting my future MIL to our wedding cruel?,"TL;DR: My future MIL told me a lie that almost sabotaged our relationship, and now I feel guilty about not inviting her to our wedding. Am I wrong?  


I (35F) recently got engaged to my fiancé (38M). He and his mom (66F) have had a very strained relationship for years—she was emotionally immature and neglectful when he and his siblings were growing up. For example, when she started dating a man who didn’t like kids, she’d kick them out on weekends. My fiancé was 18 and slept in his car; his younger brothers were 15 and 12.

Now she’s trying to mend those relationships, but it’s not a priority for any of them. I’ve always had compassion for her and thought it’d be good for our son (2) to have another grandparent, so I encouraged my fiancé to accept her offer to take us (plus one of his brothers + family) on a vacation.

The trip was tense from the start. Then, while everyone else was out or napping, MIL cornered me and whispered that my fiancé had told his brother he “doesn’t believe in marriage” and “never planned to marry me”—this supposedly happened after our son was born. I was completely blindsided, since we’d been discussing engagement and ring design.

I told my fiancé when he got back—he was furious and insisted it was a lie. He divulged to me that he had already bought a ring, and both his brother and SIL confirmed the convo never happened. When he confronted his mom, she blew up at ME for telling him, and told me I was destroying her chance at a relationship with her son. It got weird. I told her we needed space and haven’t spoken since the trip, aside from her mailing a few gifts to our son.

Fast forward a few months - we’re engaged and wedding planning. My mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer, so we’re planning it sooner than later. We decided to invite only his brothers + their wives for his side of the family. Not his mom. She has a history of sabotaging meaningful family events, and we want this day to be peaceful and joyful. Maybe this is crazy, but I can't help but feel guilty. I’m super close with my family and can’t imagine being excluded from my own child’s wedding. I know she’s responsible for the situation, but it still feels awful.

Is there a better way to handle this? Or is it OK to trust our instincts and kindly, firmly set this boundary?",118,1kv9hxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kv9hxe/is_not_inviting_my_future_mil_to_our_wedding_cruel/
Scared About Moving In Together,"Me (28F) and my boyfriend (27M) are moving in together very soon and I already struggle with relationship anxiety as it is, so now that it's getting really real I'm getting really anxious. We've been together for 5 years so we definitely know each other REALLY well. We've had tough times and have learned a lot together about how to compromise and how to show up for each other in the way the other person needs. We bicker a lot but 95% of the time we end up laughing at ourselves. We rarely argue and never fight, I think I've yelled at him 2 times and he's never yelled at me. We have a lot of fun together and love being with each other and spending time with our friends together

I have this fear that us moving in together is going to ruin everything. That we'll realize we don't enjoy each other's company as much as we thought we did and become unhappy and break up. 

This is basically our final step before deciding to get married and start our own family. We talk about it a lot and want similar things from life and have a lot of the same ideas about how to raise children and where we would want to live, all that jazz. I'm just scared it'll all blow up in my face after so much time. 

If anyone felt similarly before moving in with their s/o and then it went well -- please tell me so I can stop listening to my anxious brain being like ""hmmmm something feels off so this must be a bad idea and it's my gut telling me it won't work out""

Tl;dr: my relationship is great but we're moving in together and I'm afraid everything will change and we'll break up",2,1kv4j8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kv4j8x/scared_about_moving_in_together/
I(28M) am having difficulties navigating this issue with my wife(31F),"We've been together for the past 5 years - married for 3. Nearly half of our entire relationship she hasn't worked. I've had numerous talks with her about this issue because she has finished Law school and seems to not want to work in that direction. Fine, okay. That's her prerogative and choice. However, when we sit down and review the budget and I explain to her that we currently have no financial difficulties for everyday life needs but we cannot save any money or go on even cheap vacations and this is putting a strain on me - she suggests we make her a resume so we can start searching for a job for her.

Where the issue lies, however, is that she doesn't want to sit down with me and write this. She esentially wants me to do this by myself. She says she has never made one and she can't do it alone. My problem is she has never even tried making one before giving up. This sounds very much like weaponized incompetence to me and I told her so. Our arguments lead to nowhere but bitterness after a fight.

This all came to a head when we were together with the in-laws yesterday. She was explaining an argument we had prior to the gathering.  The argument was about some tiles that needed to be picked up as they were going to be laid for our new apartment. The shop had told me the tiles were to be delivered at 5pm on Friday. After talking with my wife I told her I wish to do this pick-up on Monday as I was dead tired to pick up some tiles alone that weren't going to be put until Monday anyway. She didn't accept that and her argument was that I didn't ask for her opinion on the matter. My reply was curt and rude - I told her that no matter her opinion on the matter I wasn't going to do it. This all spiraled and lead to the night in question.

During the gathering with the in-laws my wife was explaining all of this. My wife's sister upon hearing the story said I wasn't in the right and that I had no right to speak like that to her. This lead to a full-blown argument where I said that we have no children and my wife isn't working. All I want from her is some leeway on these issues as I feel overtired working alone. She has no driver's license by choice so whenever she has stuff to do I go pick her up and we do it. I have a great job working with my father so I do this during working hours when I'm free, as well. This has put some further resentment from me as she can do these stuff alone but she doesn't want to. She says that I only think about myself and my needs and not hers, whenever I express I don't want to do this every time. BUT IM SO FUCKING TIRED. The stress of having to work for 2 people in these times is making my head spin. Upon hearing my displeasement with my wife on this issue her sister went feral. Told me she can't believe the words coming out of my mouth and then went on a rant about me telling me if I had such a problem with my wife not working I should just find her a job and make her resume myself. Otherwise, I cannot complain. My wife stood in agreement during all of this. Standing there and being scolded by these people while my wife stood in agreement about not working was making me see red beyond imagination. The irony in all of this is that my wife's sister isn't currently working and her husband is having mental problems having to cope with working a lot and not having enough rest for him.

I honestly don't know what I'm even asking. Can you give me advice? Being told by so many people that I'm wrong for having this opinion is making me second guess myself even further. I'm depressed all the time and having to suck-up, be quiet and continue like this is making me wish I was never married in the first place.

TL:DR; My wife and in-laws are against me making my wife go to work. This all came to a head yesterday where I was told I'm in the wrong. Can you please advice?",61,1kv4gks,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kv4gks/i28m_am_having_difficulties_navigating_this_issue/
A Commitment-phobe’s dilemma before marriage,"[M35] bought the ring 5 months ago. I’ve had 2 chances (trips abroad) to propose, and didn’t. I get the determination to do it for a day or two, then fear creeps in and thoughts that I’ll never be with anyone else.

She [F28] is an amazing partner. Considerate, loving, smart - a fantastic woman. Our sex has never been out of this world, but it’s been decent and sustained during the 4 years we’ve been together.

I am fully aware I am the problem - I think about women frequently, the excitement of meeting them, seducing, seeing and touching them. It’s a problem, but I deal with it by talking to a professional, staying away from porn, etc.

The other side of me wants to take the plunge and move on with my life and feel comfortable with who I am, the person I’m with, and hopefully build a family together.

My question is for people who felt this way (50/50 about committing to a monogamous long term relationship with a great person - simply out of fear of commitment)…did you end up marrying this person? How did that work out for you? Does this feeling go away?

TL;DR: I’ve been with my amazing partner for 4 years, bought a ring 5 months ago but keep getting cold feet. I’m torn between wanting to commit and fearing monogamy. Curious if others in this situation ended up marrying and if the fear went away.",0,1kv42da,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kv42da/a_commitmentphobes_dilemma_before_marriage/
I (19m) feel like me and my friend (19f) have entered a strange spot in our friendship that I need to talk to someone about. (Very long post),"Myself (19m) and a friend (19f) of mine have entered a strange time together. For context, I’ve been friends with her for 5/6 years, we went to highschool together but we didn’t go to the same college. It was the same overall college but just different branches/departments and buildings. I went and did my A-levels whereas she had always been a massive animal lover and so she studied animal care at a local farm just a  5 minute walk from my house. 

We spoke for hours and hours every single day. I caught feelings for her-she was just everything I could ever hope to have in someone. However I knew nothing would come of it since she always said that she wasn’t ready for a relationship whenever the topic was brought up. She would say that she’s scared of them because she felt that it would feel forced and fake and that the commitment was another thing that scared her because she didn’t want a relationship to feel like a chore or a job. And so I didn’t pursue and instead kept my feelings to myself, and got on with life.

This went on for months until one night I broke down and told her how I felt and how I already knew that it wouldn’t lead to anything, and I was right. We didn’t get together but we stayed close friends. She thought it was sweet that I felt I could talk to her even about something like that and was thankful for my honesty but that she just wasn’t ready. Which is exactly what I knew it would be like-in my head I already knew that nothing would come of it so in fact I wasn’t too hurt by the rejection. I simply had to tell her how I felt, I had felt that way for months and the feelings and want to say something just became too much for me to handle anymore and so I told her.

After that night we went and carried on as we were, as friends. My feelings for her never went away though as much as I wanted and thought they should, after a few more months it became too much for me and I had a mental dip. I was upset I couldn’t stop how I felt and be normal. I lost all motivation and everything became dull in my life. Our friendship whilst we both wanted it to continue, I started to feel awkward around her because it felt like torture in my chest to be there knowing I felt how I felt but couldn’t be lucky enough to be with her.

Little by little our conversations became drier and drier until in December 2023 they just stopped completely. I know that it was my fault why it happened but it became painful to talk to her and not being able to move on like I desperately wanted to in order to save our friendship. Sadly we stopped speaking for a year and 3 months.

In that time I went through a bad 6 months long relationship, I lost my virginity, enjoyed the first few months of that relationship and had finally managed to move on from her. And yet we continued to not speak. My relationship ended when I discovered that who I was with had cheated on me with someone I had called a friend for years before that point. 

I finished college and got my A- levels and months later a cat photo was sent into a group chat that myself and my friend used to talk together in but had gone dead after we stopped speaking. We both reacted to the cat photo and spoke to each other in the group for a little while before moving to our DMs. The friendship was back. And all it took was a cat photo. 

We were both ecstatic to be talking to each other again. I apologised for not messaging and basically leaving and gave my half of the reasons behind it (which I have already told you). Her side of the story was that she was scared that I didn’t want to be friends with her anymore and that she had missed me a lot. I had missed her a lot too. I missed our talks, our inside jokes, our late night conversations. We stepped back into our friendship so easily it was as if the last year hadn’t had happened at all. It was exactly how things used to be. It was PERFECT.  We caught up, spoke for hours and hours, it was 20 to 5 in the morning when we went to sleep.  Everything was back to how we both had wished it had been, and for a few weeks everything was amazing.

And then it happened, I caught feelings again, not as strongly as the first time and it isn’t affecting our friendship. And I’m actually able to keep myself in check this time and not let them take over. It’s now been 3 months since we started speaking again and life just seems so much better than what it was like without her. My feelings for her seem to come and go to an extent, some days I feel them strongly whilst other days it’s more so in the background of my mind. When we talk I just feel at peace in a way I have never felt with anyone else.

I feel like this time there may actually be a chance though as when we’re asked about our ideal date we say the exact same thing, we share so many hobbies and passions, whenever we’re having deep conversations we just connect and we both know exactly how the other is feeling at any given time without them even having to say anything. 

Whenever the idea of a relationship is brought up she now says that she likes the sound of one but wouldn’t be able to get into one. She says that her ideal relationship would be one where there’s a deep connection before deciding to date, she also says that she’d want to be friends with benefits before committing to dating with that person so she already knows what it’s like and doesn’t make sex feel like an awkward topic in her head to actually discuss or do  when with that person. 

We are very very close and very very open with each other to the point where we know each others kinks and whilst she’s a virgin she knows what she’d like. When we talk about stuff like that she often asks what I did with my ex and sometimes she says my ex was lucky. I know that some of the stuff I say I’ve done and would like to do is stuff she’d love too, I can tell by how she responds and often tells me that she’d love that. I don’t know if she just feels comfortable enough with me to tell me stuff like that or if she’s dropping hints she wants to do it with me but is too shy to fully say it. She’s always complimenting me and when she’s not, it’s the jokey loving insults.

I’m just a little bit confused and worried- I don’t want to mess things up again. We’ve arranged to go out together one night in a few weeks and have a picnic together whilst watching the sunset, stargaze and talk the whole night together whilst eating cake and have a drink together and then watch the sunrise. What’s odd is that that EXACT scenario is the one we both said our dream/perfect date would be. We’re going to bring a blanket and lay in a field for an evening and night living out our dream date together. How is that not meant to ignite a tiniest bit of hope in me? Or am i just being delusional?

I’m just very scared to say or do anything in case I’m misreading things and I don’t want to plunge us back into another needless break from each other. I would do anything for her, and she knows it. I would be so so happy if something between us happened but I’m not going to try and speak up and say anything like that because I don’t want to risk it. Sometimes there’s perfect opportunities to flirt and I feel like she words things in a way just to tempt me to but I don’t let myself just in case that’s not what she’s doing at all. Like I said at the very beginning, it’s a strange time in our relationship. 

I would love to know what other people think of my situation. Whether I’m looking too deeply into things that mean nothing at all or if there might be a chance?   

TL;DR: I have feelings for my friend but I’m not sure if I should pursue. We’re going on a dream “date” but not actually together. What do I do?",1,1kv374l,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kv374l/i_19m_feel_like_me_and_my_friend_19f_have_entered/
I(17M) feel like I have lost my best friend (17F) and it's all my fault,"Me and K(17F) have been friends for quite a long time, almost 10 years but we didnt see each other for a while due to the shift from primary to early secondary, but we became friends again a couple years ago. However over the last school year we became really close, easily and quickly becoming best friends.

I never really thought too much of her as more than a best friend up until about 3 months ago. I was at some gathering for a friend's birthday, and late in the night someone half-drunkedly said ""When are you gonna ask K out?"" Everyone there agreed, even people who were completely sober. Alongside this time were other occasions similar: Me, K, her friend and my friend were in a study session together, until K and her mate left to go somewhere. Then my other friend said to me the second after she left, ""How could you not tell she's heads over heels with you,"" following it up with 'evidence that she did.' All these little occasions continued to happen every now and then over the next three months up until now.

Prior to this we were extremely close. She would send updates of her day whenever she could, she'd send me voice messages, vent about work or school, send me videos of her most recent shopping hauls, send tiktoks quite often, ask me advice or opinions on what she should buy, and ask if I would go places, most of the time in school for study periods but also outside of school. Her texts were often full of life emotion and passion. When she'd see me in person, she would light up and shiny-ly greet me. We would always joke about when we were with each other and laugh at whatever we said. Our teachers noticed how much we talked, to the point where we had been asked several times to shut up, and they brought it up during parents evenings - she would almost always start these conversations. She also made it somewhat obvious that she wanted to still be close in the future, she asked where I thought I would be going to uni, if I would ever go clubbing with her (she drinks but I don't), and I'm assuming jokingly asking if we would ever go to a country abroad together (we both have a language class together). So so much more but I think thats enough.

Thoughts about me and my future have been eating me up inside, thinking that I will live full of regret about the life I live right now. She knows this, because a bit prior to when I asked if she thought of me as more than a friend (I'll get to that later) I talked about how uncomfortable I felt in my own skin, how I find it so hard to exercise properly because everything -bones joints etc - hurts, and how I struggled looking at my reflection, because I couldn't stand how skinny I, especially my arms, was. She was so nice and understanding, saying that she'll be there for me and saying really nice things.

Another regret I had in my mind was that what if she really DID like me, like my friends (including one of her old mates - they had a bit of a disagreement a while back) said before. This was eating me up inside, I didn't want to feel like i missed a chance of being with her in the future especially if we would still be friends, because what can you do with an expired crush? It's not like I particularly wanted her to say yes, I just wanted us to still be close no matter what.

So I asked her; I'll write what I said exactly here:


> right im about to go to bed so i may as well just say now
i just wanted to know if u like me as more than a friend
im sorry if this makes u uncomfortable or ive overstepped a boundary but i just feel like i need to know
ive put this off for a while because being friends with you is amazing and id never want to harm that
but i feel like in the future im gonna have a lot of regrets about decisions ive made and opportunities ive missed, and i just dont want you to be one of them
i know our relationship might not be the same after this, but i hope that even if you dont we can still be close friends and we can go back to normal

She read it in the morning leaving me on opened for about fifteen minutes, and I genuinely felt like I would never speak to her again which destroyed me. In the end she said she didn't want us to change our friendship, and she said that I was genuinely her closest friend - the first time anyone let alone her said that to me - which actually destroyed me and I genuinely cried over this. She was really nice asking if we could still be friends and I said yes 100% which she was happy with. This was all Thursday morning. 

However after this I feel like we've become more distant. We barely spoke in person over the next two days, tbf we didn't have many lessons or study periods together. But alongside that, I feel like her texting has been a bit more dry and less of the emotion that used to be there, and definitely the quantity has dropped. Thursday afternoon I asked her three questions:

A: Will we still try to be close friends in the future?
""Yes silly""

B: If ever I feel bad about myself can I have a consolation hug?
""Of course""

C: It's not much of a question, but can I tell you something, preferably face to face, but I could also just send you it
""Whatever you think is best for you""

Obviously the answers aren't exact but they are roughly that

Few days have gone by and I still haven't said what i wanted to say, nor has she brought it up.

It's school holiday now for a week, so I probably won't see her over it, and so our contact is now restricted to  just Snapchat and TikTok. 

Saturday goes by, we didn't text as much, but there was still a little bit there, quantity was still lacking, and she didnt text about her day as much as she would unless enquired about, which would still not be too much for an answer, but it felt like at least something.

Now Sunday, today. Left me on delivered for a large while, 12 hours, and she was awake for the last 4/5. During this time I turned my snapmaps on for everyone ( I thought I had it on for everyone, but it was just for my mum oops ). After this she responded within a couple minutes with a pretty dry response to the point were a convo was not salvageable in the slightest, and then turned off her location on snapmaps. I used to be one of the only people that could see her, as she didnt have it on for most people, but a few minutes after I turned mine on I could no longer see hers.

She recently reposted a TikTok, today or yesterday, about how being the oldest sister she never had much time to rely on anyone and was independant for herself and never getting too attached to anyone, but she now just wants to be loved by someone. Probably not even close to being about me but I feel like its a bit significant.

I'm so scared, because now it's a week of no physical contact, she seems to me to be less interested in being friends, and I'm terrified of losing her, because she is such a fantastic friend, and it feels like my fears are becoming reality.

TL;DR - I asked if my close girl best friend had feelings for me which she denied and responded saying I was genuinely her closest friend on Thursday, but it feels like we are becoming more distant by the day, and now I'm hijacked by my fear

Communication breakdown with partner of 3 years - is this fixable?,"My (35F) partner (47M) have been navigating a difficult period in our relationship. I’ve been meaning to write this for some time, hoping things would improve and I wouldn’t need to—but here I am.

We’ve been together for nearly three years, and up until recently, our relationship was the healthiest and happiest I’ve ever experienced. We rarely argued—just the occasional disagreement, handled with mutual respect and open communication. Even during quieter times, we would check in with each other and stay connected. It felt stable, emotionally safe, and deeply fulfilling.

A couple of months ago, we took our first big overseas trip together. It went smoothly, and there were no signs of strain or tension. But following the trip, things shifted.

We don’t live together, so regular messages and phone calls have always been important for maintaining our connection. Lately, that rhythm has changed drastically. Communication became inconsistent—days without a message unless I initiated contact, messages left on read, and a noticeable lack of engagement from him. It felt like the standard we had both upheld suddenly disappeared, without explanation.

While I understand that his life is extremely demanding—he has children and holds a senior executive role—this wasn’t an issue before. I started to feel like I was always available to him, but the same wasn’t true in return.

A few weeks ago, the emotional distance began to take a toll on me—so much so that it affected our intimacy. I take responsibility for that; when I feel disconnected emotionally, physical closeness becomes difficult for me. I asked him if I had done something wrong. He reassured me that I hadn’t, and expressed warmth and understanding. In that moment, I felt heard and seen.

But it wasn’t long before things slipped back. This past weekend, I heard from him only twice via text and had a short phone call where he snapped at me. In fairness, he is genuinely under immense stress, and I’m not making excuses—I just want to acknowledge that his circumstances are complex. For privacy reasons, I won’t elaborate on what he’s dealing with.

Still, I find myself constantly hoping, “Maybe next week it’ll go back to how it was. Just hold on a little longer.” But the weight of that hope is becoming heavier each day. I’ve tried to be a source of support and light in his life, especially while he’s struggling—but I’m hurting in the process.

So I’m turning to this community for perspective. Is this something we can work through? How do I approach him with compassion, without abandoning my own emotional needs in the process?

TL;DR: My partner is going through a lot and communication has dropped significantly. I feel increasingly hurt and neglected, and I’m trying to figure out how to support him without losing myself in the process.",2,1kv2fus,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kv2fus/communication_breakdown_with_partner_of_3_years/
